# Tutorial: Setting Up and Using a Ceph Cluster in Ubuntu Using MicroCeph for Single-Node Deployment

## Prerequisites:
- Multi-core processor
- At least 8GiB of memory
- 100GB of disk space
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

## Step-by-Step Guide:

### Step 1: Install MicroCeph
First, you need to install MicroCeph on your system. Open a terminal and run the following command:
  
sudo snap install microceph

### Step 2: Bootstrap the Cluster
Once MicroCeph is installed, you can bootstrap the cluster with the following command:
  
sudo microceph cluster bootstrap

### Step 3: Check Cluster Status
To verify the status of the cluster, use the following command:
  
sudo microceph.ceph status
You should see that there is a single node in the cluster.

### Step 4: Modify CRUSH Rules
To use MicroCeph as a single node, you need to modify the default CRUSH rules:
  
sudo microceph.ceph osd crush rule rm replicated_rule
sudo microceph.ceph osd crush rule create-replicated single default osd

### Step 5: Add Disks as OSDs
Add the disks that will be used as Object Storage Daemons (OSDs). Replace `/dev/sd[x]` with the appropriate disk identifier. This will wipe the disk, so ensure you choose the correct disk and have backups if necessary.
  
sudo microceph disk add /dev/sd[x] --wipe
Repeat this step for each disk you would like to use as an OSD on that node.

### Step 6: Verify Cluster Status
After adding the disks, you can verify the cluster status using the following commands:
  
sudo microceph.ceph status
sudo microceph.ceph osd status

### Conclusion
Following these steps, you should have a single-node Ceph cluster set up and running using MicroCeph. You can now use this setup for testing and development purposes.

Note: Replace `/dev/sd[x]` with the actual disk identifier for your system.
