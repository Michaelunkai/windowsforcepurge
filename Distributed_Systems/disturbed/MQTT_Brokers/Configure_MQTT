Configure MQTT
You can configure MQTT settings in RabbitMQ by editing its configuration file.

Open the configuration file for editing:

 
 
sudo nano /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf
Add MQTT configuration settings:
Hereâ€™s a basic example that sets up MQTT to listen on port 1883 (the default MQTT port):

arduino
 
mqtt.listeners.tcp.default = 1883
Optionally, you can specify additional settings like MQTT protocol versions or TLS configurations.

Save and exit the editor.

Restart RabbitMQ to apply the changes:

 
 
sudo systemctl restart rabbitmq-server
