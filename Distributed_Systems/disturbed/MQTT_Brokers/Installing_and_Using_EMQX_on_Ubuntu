# Comprehensive Guide to Installing and Using EMQX on Ubuntu

## Introduction
EMQX (Erlang MQTT Broker) is a highly scalable, open-source MQTT broker suitable for IoT, M2M, and mobile applications. This guide will walk you through the process of installing EMQX on Ubuntu, configuring it, and using it with MQTT clients.

## Step 1: Installation

### Run the Installation Command
Execute the following command to install EMQX:

  
cd && curl -s https://assets.emqx.com/scripts/install-emqx-deb.sh | sudo bash && sudo apt-get install emqx -y && sudo systemctl start emqx && sudo systemctl status emqx

This command will:
1. Change to the home directory.
2. Download and run the EMQX installation script.
3. Install EMQX using `apt-get`.
4. Start the EMQX service.
5. Check the status of the EMQX service.

## Step 2: Verify Installation

### Check EMQX Status
Ensure that EMQX is running by checking its status:

  
sudo systemctl status emqx

You should see output indicating that EMQX is active (running).

## Step 3: Access EMQX Dashboard

### Open the Dashboard
The EMQX dashboard allows you to manage and monitor your EMQX instance through a web interface.

1. Open a web browser.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:18083`.
3. Log in with the default username and password:
   - **Username:** admin
   - **Password:** public

## Step 4: Configure EMQX

### Configuration via Dashboard
You can configure various aspects of EMQX through the dashboard. For more advanced configurations, you may need to edit the configuration files directly.

### Configuration Files
EMQX configuration files are located in `/etc/emqx`. The main configuration file is `emqx.conf`.

To edit the configuration file, use a text editor like `nano`:

  
sudo nano /etc/emqx/emqx.conf

After making changes, restart EMQX to apply them:

  
sudo systemctl restart emqx

## Step 5: Use EMQX with MQTT Clients

### Publishing and Subscribing with Mosquitto
You can use MQTT clients such as Mosquitto to publish and subscribe to topics on EMQX.

#### Publish a Message
To publish a message to a topic:

  
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t test/topic -m "Hello EMQX"

#### Subscribe to a Topic
To subscribe to a topic and receive messages:

  
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t test/topic

## Step 6: Troubleshooting

### Checking EMQX Logs
If you encounter issues, check the EMQX logs for errors:

  
sudo journalctl -u emqx.service

### Consult Documentation
For more detailed troubleshooting and advanced configurations, refer to the [EMQX documentation](https://docs.emqx.io) and community forums.
