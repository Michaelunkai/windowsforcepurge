Step 1: Update Your System
First, ensure your system is up to date by running the following commands:

 
 
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
Step 2: Install Erlang
RabbitMQ requires Erlang to be installed. You can install Erlang by following these steps:

Add the Erlang repository:
 
 
sudo apt install -y gnupg
wget -O- https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/ubuntu/erlang_solutions.asc | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) contrib" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/erlang.list
Update your package list and install Erlang:
 
 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y erlang
Step 3: Install RabbitMQ
Add the RabbitMQ repository:
 
 
wget -O- https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://packagecloud.io/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/ubuntu/ $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rabbitmq.list
Update your package list and install RabbitMQ:
 
 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y rabbitmq-server
Step 4: Enable and Start RabbitMQ Server
Enable RabbitMQ to start on boot and start the RabbitMQ server:

 
 
sudo systemctl enable rabbitmq-server
sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server
Step 5: Enable the RabbitMQ Management Console
RabbitMQ comes with a handy management console that you can enable with the following command:

 
 
sudo rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
Step 6: Create a RabbitMQ User
Create a new RabbitMQ user and set permissions. Replace your-username and your-password with your desired username and password:

 
 
sudo rabbitmqctl add_user your-username your-password
sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags your-username administrator
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / your-username ".*" ".*" ".*"
Step 7: Configure RabbitMQ (Optional)
You can configure RabbitMQ by editing the configuration file located at /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf. Open the file with your preferred text editor:

 
 
sudo nano /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf
You can set various configurations here. For example, to change the default port or configure SSL/TLS.

Step 8: Access RabbitMQ Management Console
The RabbitMQ Management Console can be accessed by navigating to http://localhost:15672 in your web browser. Log in with the username and password you created in Step 6.

Step 9: Verify the Installation
To ensure RabbitMQ is running correctly, you can check the service status:

 
 
sudo systemctl status rabbitmq-server
Additionally, you can verify the status of RabbitMQ using the command:

 
 
sudo rabbitmqctl status
Step 10: Enable Firewall (Optional)
If you have a firewall enabled, you’ll need to allow traffic on the RabbitMQ ports. The default ports are 5672 for AMQP connections and 15672 for the management console:

 
 
sudo ufw allow 5672
sudo ufw allow 15672
Step 11: Securing RabbitMQ (Optional)
To enhance security, consider the following steps:

Disable the default guest user if you don’t need it:

 
 
sudo rabbitmqctl delete_user guest
Use SSL/TLS for secure communication (configure SSL settings in /etc/rabbitmq/rabbitmq.conf).

Set up user permissions to restrict access.

With these steps, RabbitMQ  ould be installed, configured, and ready for use on your Ubuntu system. You can now use RabbitMQ for your messaging needs. If you encounter any issues, refer to the RabbitMQ documentation for further assistance.
