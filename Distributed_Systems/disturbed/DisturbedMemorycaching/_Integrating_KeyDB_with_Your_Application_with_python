Integrating KeyDB with Your Application
You can now integrate KeyDB with your application for caching purposes using libraries for various programming languages (e.g., Python, Node.js, PHP).

For Python:

 
 
pip install keydb
Sample code:

 
 
import keydb

client = keydb.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, password='YourStrongPassword')

client.set('key', 'value')
print(client.get('key'))
