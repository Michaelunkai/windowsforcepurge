**Memcached** is an open-source, high-performance, distributed memory caching system. It is designed to speed up dynamic web applications by reducing the database load by caching data and objects in memory. Here's a brief overview:

- **In-Memory Cache**: Memcached stores data in RAM to ensure fast retrieval.
- **Key-Value Store**: It stores data as key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a specific value.
- **Distributed**: Memcached can be distributed across multiple servers, enabling horizontal scaling.
- **Use Cases**: Commonly used for caching database queries, session data, API calls, and frequently accessed data in web applications.

Memcached helps improve the performance and scalability of websites and applications by providing quick access to cached data, reducing database load and latency.
