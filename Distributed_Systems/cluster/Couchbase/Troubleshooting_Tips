Troubleshooting Tips
Connection Issues:

Ensure Couchbase Server is running and accessible from your machine.
Check firewall settings to allow traffic on Couchbase ports (default is 8091 for the web console).
Authentication Errors:

Verify that the username and password in ~/.cbsh/config are correct.
Ensure the user has the necessary permissions to perform operations.
cbsh Not Found:

Make sure /usr/local/bin is in your PATH. You can check with:

 
 
echo $PATH
If not, add it by editing ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:

 
 
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
Then, reload the shell:

 
 
source ~/. rc
