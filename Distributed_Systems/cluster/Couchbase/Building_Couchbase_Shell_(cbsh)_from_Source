If you prefer to build cbsh from source instead of using precompiled binaries, follow these steps.

Step 3.1: Install Rust and Cargo
Install Rust via rustup

 
 
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
Follow the on-screen instructions. After installation, reload your shell configuration:

 
 
source $HOME/.cargo/env
Verify Installation

 
 
rustc --version
cargo --version
Step 3.2: Clone the couchbase-shell Repository
 
 
git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-shell.git
cd couchbase-shell
Step 3.3: Build cbsh
Build in Debug Mode

 
 
cargo build
Note: Debug builds are slower and larger.

Build in Release Mode

For optimized performance:

 
 
cargo build --release
The binary will be located at target/release/cbsh.

Step 3.4: Install cbsh Binary
Move the Binary to /usr/local/bin

 
 
sudo mv target/release/cbsh /usr/local/bin/
Grant Execute Permissions

 
 
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cbsh
Verify Installation

 
 
cbsh --version
