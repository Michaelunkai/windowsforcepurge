# The Ultimate Complete Step-by-Step PowerShell Tutorial for Automatically Converting Multiple Scattered File Explorer Windows into One Unified Tabbed Interface Using ExplorerTabUtility with Automated Installation, Path Preservation, and Window Management

## Installation and Window Consolidation One-Liner

```powershell
$paths = (New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application).Windows() | Where-Object {$_.Name -eq "Windows Explorer"} | ForEach-Object {$_.LocationURL -replace "file:///",""} | Where-Object {$_ -ne $null}; Get-Process explorer | Where-Object {$_.MainWindowTitle -ne ""} | Stop-Process -Force; winget install w4po.ExplorerTabUtility --interactive --accept-source-agreements --accept-package-agreements; Start-Sleep 3; if($paths) { explorer ($paths[0] -replace "%20"," "); Start-Sleep 2; $paths[1..($paths.Count-1)] | ForEach-Object { Start-Sleep 800; explorer ($_ -replace "%20"," ") } } else { explorer }
```

**What this does:**
1. Captures all current File Explorer window paths
2. Closes all existing File Explorer windows
3. Installs ExplorerTabUtility automatically
4. Reopens all your previous locations (ExplorerTabUtility will convert them to tabs)
5. If no previous windows existed, just opens File Explorer

## Uninstall and Disable One-Liner

```powershell
winget uninstall w4po.ExplorerTabUtility; Get-Process "ExplorerTabUtility" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force
```
