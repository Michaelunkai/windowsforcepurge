## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Main Thread**: Handles GUI updates and user interactions
- **Background Thread**: Performs file system scanning to keep GUI responsive
- **Signal/Slot System**: Ensures thread-safe communication

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient `os.walk()` traversal
- Directory-level filtering to skip entire subtrees
- Progress updates every 1000 files to minimize GUI overhead
- Memory-efficient file data storage

### Error Handling
- **Permission Errors**: Logged and skipped, scan continues
- **File Not Found**: Handled gracefully during deletion
- **General I/O Errors**: Comprehensive error messages displayed
- **Thread Safety**: Proper cleanup on application exit

### File Filtering Logic
The application excludes files whose paths contain these keywords (case-insensitive):
- `microsoft` - Windows system files
- `asus` - ASUS hardware/software files  
- `nvidia` - NVIDIA graphics drivers/software
- `python` - Python installation files
- `pip` - Python package manager files
- `docker` - Docker containerization files
- `wsl 2` - Windows Subsystem for Linux files
- `wemod` - WeModTools application files
- `cursor` - Cursor IDE files

## Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied" Errors
- Run the application as administrator
- Some system files cannot be deleted even with admin rights (this is normal)

### Application Not Responding
- Large drives may take time to scan (progress shown in status bar)
- Use the "Stop Scan" button if needed

### Files Not Appearing in Results
- Check if file paths contain filtered keywords
- Ensure files are accessible (not locked by other processes)

### Deletion Failures  
- Verify file still exists (may have been moved/deleted)
- Check if file is currently in use by another application
- Ensure sufficient permissions

## Safety Best Practices

1. **Always backup important data** before using any file deletion tool
2. **Research unfamiliar files** before deleting them
3. **Start with smaller, obviously unnecessary files** (downloads, temp files, etc.)
4. **Avoid deleting system files** even if they appear large
5. **Monitor system performance** after deletions
6. **Keep the application updated** for latest safety improvements

## Support & Development

This application is designed for experienced Windows users who understand file system management. If you're unsure about deleting any file, please:
- Research the file online
- Consult with IT professionals
- Use built-in Windows disk cleanup tools first

## License

This software is provided "as-is" without any warranties. Users are responsible for any consequences of file deletions performed with this tool.
