To obtain a Trakt client ID, you need to create a Trakt API application. This is done by visiting trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new and following the instructions. You'll need to provide details about your application, and upon creating it, you'll receive a unique Client ID and Client Secret. These credentials are essential for accessing the Trakt API. 
Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. Create a Trakt Application:
Go to https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new and fill out the required information, including the application name and redirect URI (which should be urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob). 
2. Save the Application:
Click the "SAVE APP" button to finalize the creation of your application. 
3. Retrieve Client ID and Secret:
After saving, you will be given a Client ID and a Client Secret. These are unique to your application and are needed for authentication when interacting with the Trakt API. 
4. Authorize the Application (if needed):
Some applications may require you to authorize your application by entering a PIN. You can find this PIN on the Trakt website after completing the authorization process. 
Once you have the Client ID and Client Secret, you can use them in your application to authenticate with the Trakt API.
