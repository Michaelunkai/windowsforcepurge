## ‚úÖ PART 1: Install OpenSpeedy via Winget

1. Open **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** as **Administrator**
2. Run the following command:

```powershell
winget install openspeedy
```

If it says it's already installed, you're good to go.

---

## ‚úÖ PART 2: Launch OpenSpeedy Manually (If `openspeedy` command doesn‚Äôt work)

OpenSpeedy isn‚Äôt always added to the system path. Instead, launch it using this direct path:

```powershell
& "C:\Users\misha\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Game1024.OpenSpeedy_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\OpenSpeedy.exe"
```

To simplify this in future, create a PowerShell alias:

```powershell
Set-Alias openspeedy "C:\Users\misha\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Game1024.OpenSpeedy_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\OpenSpeedy.exe"
```

---

## ‚úÖ PART 3: Launch Your Game

Launch your target game (e.g., Bramble: The Mountain King) like this:

```powershell
Start-Process "F:\games\Bramble_TMK\Bramble_TMK-Win64-Shipping.exe"
```

Let the game fully load into gameplay mode (not just the launcher/menu screen).

---

## ‚úÖ PART 4: Speed Up the Game in OpenSpeedy‚Äôs Interface

Once both OpenSpeedy and your game are running:

1. In **OpenSpeedy**, find your game process:

   ```
   Bramble_TMK-Win64-Shipping.exe
   ```

   (‚úÖ You already saw it in the list.)

2. **Click on the row** to select the game.

3. **Set the speed multiplier:**

   * Use the slider or type `3.00` or `5.00` in the right-hand input box.
   * This sets the game speed to **300%** or **500%**.

4. **Enable acceleration** by checking the box in the last column (titled `ÊòØÂê¶Âä†ÈÄü`, meaning "Accelerate?").

   ‚úÖ If it‚Äôs **not checked**, the speed effect will NOT apply!

---

## ‚úÖ PART 5: Optional Hotkeys (Real-Time Adjustments)

| Shortcut         | Function        |
| ---------------- | --------------- |
| `Ctrl + Alt + =` | Increase speed  |
| `Ctrl + Alt + -` | Decrease speed  |
| `Ctrl + Alt + 0` | Reset to normal |

Use these in real time to fine-tune the speed during gameplay.

---

## ‚úÖ PART 6: Optional AutoHotkey v2 Script to Automate It All

Here's an AutoHotkey v2 script to automate:

* Launching OpenSpeedy
* Launching your game
* Selecting it
* Setting 300% speed

```autohotkey
#Requires AutoHotkey v2.0+

; Run OpenSpeedy
Run '"C:\Users\misha\AppData\Local\Microsoft\WinGet\Packages\Game1024.OpenSpeedy_Microsoft.Winget.Source_8wekyb3d8bbwe\OpenSpeedy.exe"'
Sleep 3000

; Run Bramble
Run "F:\games\Bramble_TMK\Bramble_TMK-Win64-Shipping.exe"
Sleep 5000

; Activate OpenSpeedy
WinActivate "OpenSpeedy"
WinWaitActive "OpenSpeedy", , 5

; Search and select the game
Send "{Tab 5}"
Sleep 300
Send "Bramble_TMK-Win64-Shipping.exe"
Sleep 500
Send "{Down}{Enter}"
Sleep 300

; Set 3.0x speed
Send "^!0"    ; Reset
Sleep 100
Send "3.0"
Send "{Enter}"
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Result

You‚Äôve now successfully:

* Installed and configured OpenSpeedy
* Launched your game
* Selected the correct process
* Set the speed to **300‚Äì500%**
* Activated acceleration
* Optionally automated the process

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* **Use ONLY for offline/single-player games** ‚Äî this will get you banned in online games.
* **Speeds above 5√ó** may break physics or cause game crashes.
* **Always reset speed (Ctrl+Alt+0)** before exiting the game to avoid issues.

If you want a fully **headless CLI-based version**, an AutoHotkey launcher with visual menu, or per-game presets, just ask ‚Äî I can build that for you too!
