To ensure that any new terminal (specifically the Windows Terminal) always opens in admin mode, you can modify its settings or create a shortcut that forces it to run as administrator. Hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. **Create a Shortcut for Windows Terminal**:
   - Right-click on the desktop or in a folder and select `New` -> `Shortcut`.
   - In the "Type the location of the item" field, enter the following path:
     %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\wt.exe
   - Click `Next` and name the shortcut something like "Windows Terminal (Admin)".
   - Click `Fini `.

2. **Set the Shortcut to Run as Administrator**:
   - Right-click on the newly created shortcut and select `Properties`.
   - Go to the `Shortcut` tab and click on the `Advanced` button.
   - Check the box that says `Run as administrator`.
   - Click `OK`, then `Apply`, and `OK` again.

3. **Use the Shortcut**:
   - Double-click the shortcut whenever you need to open Windows Terminal with administrative privileges.

If you want to ensure that Windows Terminal always opens in admin mode regardless of how it's launched, you can modify its execution policy in the task scheduler:

1. **Open Task Scheduler**:
   - Press `Win + R`, type `taskschd.msc`, and press `Enter`.

2. **Create a New Task**:
   - In the Task Scheduler, click on `Create Task` in the right-hand pane.
   - In the `General` tab, name the task something like "Windows Terminal Admin".
   - Check the box that says `Run with highest privileges`.

3. **Set the Trigger**:
   - Go to the `Triggers` tab and click `New`.
   - Set the trigger to `At log on` if you want it to start at login, or set another trigger as per your needs.
   - Click `OK`.

4. **Set the Action**:
   - Go to the `Actions` tab and click `New`.
   - In the "Program/script" field, enter:
     %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\wt.exe
   - Click `OK`.

5. **Finish and Save**:
   - Click `OK` to save the task.

This will ensure that Windows Terminal always opens with administrative privileges when triggered by the specified event.
