Update Microsoft Surface RT Tablet to Windows 10 [Unofficial Upgrade]
Disclaimer
Windows 10 Build 15035 is now [over] five years old and it should not be considered as suitable for daily use. In addition to being outdated, it has numerous bugs and other issues expected of an expired pre-release build. -https://jwa4.gitbook.io/windows/tools/windows-media-builder

This process will overwrite the current Windows 8 RT operating system on the Surface RT tablet. I have tested these steps on my own device (as shown in this video), but I am not responsible if you damage or brick your device. Verify this process will work on your device before starting and make sure to backup any data you do not want to lose before proceeding.
