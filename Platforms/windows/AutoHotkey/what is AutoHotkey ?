AutoHotkey is a free, open-source scripting language for Windows that allows users to create scripts for automating repetitive tasks, enhancing productivity, and customizing user interfaces. It is particularly popular for its ease of use and flexibility, enabling users to automate almost anything by simulating keystrokes, mouse movements, and clicks, or by interacting with various Windows applications and system components.

Key features of AutoHotkey include:

1. **Hotkeys and Hotstrings**: Define custom keyboard shortcuts to perform actions or replace text.
2. **Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks, such as filling forms, opening applications, or performing complex sequences of actions.
3. **GUI Creation**: Create simple graphical user interfaces for scripts, such as dialog boxes and input forms.
4. **Macro Recording**: Record and playback macros to automate sequences of actions.
5. **Integration**: Integrate with other applications and system components to extend their functionality.

AutoHotkey scripts are written in a plain text file with the `.ahk` extension, and they can be compiled into standalone executables for distribution.

Here's a simple example of an AutoHotkey script that types "Hello, World!" when the user presses `Ctrl + Alt + H`:

```ahk
^!h::
Send, Hello, World!
return
```

In this example:
- `^` represents the `Ctrl` key.
- `!` represents the `Alt` key.
- `h` is the `H` key.
- `Send, Hello, World!` sends the text "Hello, World!" to the active window.
- `return` ends the hotkey definition.
