1. Check and Create 'Departments' Organizational Unit (OU):
 
 
$DepartmentsOU = Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter { Name -eq 'Departments' }

if (!$DepartmentsOU) {
    New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "Departments" -Path "DC=micha,DC=com"
    Write-Host "The 'Departments' OU was created."
} else {
    Write-Host "The 'Departments' OU already exists."
}
2. Check and Create 'ITDepartment' Organizational Unit (OU):
 
 
$ITDepartmentOU = Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter { Name -eq 'ITDepartment' }

if (!$ITDepartmentOU) {
    New-ADOrganizationalUnit -Name "ITDepartment" -Path "OU=Departments,DC=micha,DC=com"
    Write-Host "The 'ITDepartment' OU was created."
} else {
    Write-Host "The 'ITDepartment' OU already exists."
}
3. Check and Create 'ITPolicy' Group Policy Object (GPO):
 
 
$GPO = Get-GPO -Name "ITPolicy"

if (!$GPO) {
    $GPO = New-GPO -Name "ITPolicy"
    Write-Host "The 'ITPolicy' GPO was created."
} else {
    Write-Host "The 'ITPolicy' GPO already exists."
}
4. Link 'ITPolicy' GPO to 'ITDepartment' OU:
 
 
if ($GPO) {
    try {
        New-GPLink -Name "ITPolicyLink" -Target "OU=ITDepartment,OU=Departments,DC=micha,DC=com" -LinkEnabled Yes -Enforced No
        Write-Host "The 'ITPolicy' GPO was successfully linked to the 'ITDepartment' OU."
    } catch {
        Write-Host "Failed to link the 'ITPolicy' GPO. $_"
    }
} else {
    Write-Host "The 'ITPolicy' GPO was not found. Please create the GPO before attempting to link it."
}
This script ensures the creation of the necessary OUs and GPO, and then links the GPO to the 'ITDepartment' OU.
