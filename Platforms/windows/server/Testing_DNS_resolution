Open PowerShell.
Run the following command to perform a DNS lookup:

Resolve-DnsName -Name "host1.example.com" -Type A

Replace "host1.example.com" with the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the host you added in the previous step.

Verify that the command returns the IP address associated with the domain name.
Optionally, you can also test reverse DNS lookup by running the following command:


Resolve-DnsName -Name "192.168.1.100" -Type PTR

Replace "192.168.1.100" with the IP address you want to test.
