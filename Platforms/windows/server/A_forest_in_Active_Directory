A forest in Active Directory is a collection of one or more domain trees that share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog. It represents the highest level of organization within Active Directory.

When setting up Active Directory for the first time, you typically have three options:

Add a new forest: Choose this if you are creating a new, independent Active Directory environment.
Add a domain to an existing forest: Opt for this if you want to add a new domain to an existing Active Directory environment.
Add a new child domain to an existing domain: Select this to create a new domain that is a child of an existing domain in the forest.
For a first-time setup, choose the first option, "Add a new forest," unless you have specific requirements to join an existing environment or create a child domain.



Creating a New Forest

Choose "Add a new forest" in the Active Directory Domain Services Configuration Wizard.
Enter a root domain name for your forest (e.g., "mycompany.com").
Choose the Forest Functional Level (typically the latest version unless you have specific compatibility requirements).
Set a Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password.
Review the summary and click "Next."
The wizard will check for DNS and warn you if necessary; resolve any issues before proceeding.
If the NetBIOS domain name is different, configure it as needed (usually, it auto-populates).
Choose the paths for the AD DS database, log files, and SYSVOL folder, or leave the default settings.
Review the summary and click "Next" to begin the prerequisite check.
Once the prerequisite check passes, click "Install" to create the new forest.
After completing this step, your server will be promoted to a domain controller, and the new forest will be established.
