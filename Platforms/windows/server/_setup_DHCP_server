Configuring DHCP Server via PowerShell
Once the installation is complete, launch PowerShell as an administrator.

Run the following command to authorize the DHCP server:

Add-DhcpServerInDC

Create a new DHCP scope with the following PowerShell command:

Add-DhcpServerV4Scope -Name "MyScope" -StartRange 192.168.1.101 -EndRange 192.168.1.200 -SubnetMask 255.255.255.0 -LeaseDuration "8.0:0:0"


Adjust the parameters (such as scope name, IP range, subnet mask, and lease duration) according to your network requirements.

Set the default gateway for the DHCP clients with:


Set-DhcpServerV4OptionValue -OptionID 3 -Value "192.168.1.1"


Set the DNS server addresses for the DHCP clients with:


Set-DhcpServerV4OptionValue -OptionID 6 -Value "windowsIP"


Replace "192.168.1.1" and "192.168.1.10" with the actual IP addresses of your default gateway and DNS server respectively.

Activate the DHCP scope with:

Set-DhcpServerv4Scope -ScopeId 192.168.1.0 -State Active
Note: Your DHCP server is now configured and ready to assign IP addresses to devices on your network.


To get more detailed information about DHCP server scopes and their configurations, you can use the following command:

Get-DhcpServerv4Scope
