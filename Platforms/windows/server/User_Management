Now that your Active Directory forest is set up, let's delve into user management:

Create a User Account:
New-ADUser -Name "mich fed" -SamAccountName "mich" -GivenName "micha" -Surname "mich" -UserPrincipalName "mygmail@gmail.com" -Enabled $true -PassThru -AccountPassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText "password" -Force)

** To list all group names in Active Directory, you can use the Get-ADGroup command. Here's the command:

 
 
Get-ADGroup -Filter * | Select-Object Name
This command retrieves all groups and then selects and displays only the "Name" property for each group. Execute this in PowerShell on your Windows Server to see a list of all group names in your Active Directory environment. If you need more details about each group, you can remove the Select-Object Name part from the command.


2)
Add-ADGroupMember -Identity "GroupName" -Members "mich"

3) etrieve User Information:

 
 
Get-ADUser -Identity "micha"

4)
Modify User Attributes:

 
 
Set-ADUser -Identity "micha" -Title "Manager" -Description "Department Head"

5)Disable a User Account:

 
 
6)Disable-ADAccount -Identity "micha"
Enable a User Account:

 
 
Enable-ADAccount -Identity "micha"


Adjust the user details and group name as needed.
