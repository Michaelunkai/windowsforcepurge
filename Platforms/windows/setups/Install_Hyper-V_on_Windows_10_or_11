Install Hyper-V on Windows 10/11
What is Hyper-V?
Hyper-V lets you run multiple operating systems as virtual machines on Windows. Hyper-V specifically provides hardware virtualization. That means each virtual machine runs on virtual hardware. Hyper-V lets you create virtual hard drives, virtual switches, and a number of other virtual devices all of which can be added to virtual machines. -https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/
