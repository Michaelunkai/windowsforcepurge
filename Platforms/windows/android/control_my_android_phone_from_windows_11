Make sure you have the latest version of Microsoft Phone Link installed on both your Windows 11 PC and Android phone. It comes pre-installed on many Windows 11 PCs.
Sign into the same Microsoft account on your PC and phone in Phone Link.
On your PC, select "Pair with QR code" and a QR code will appear. On your phone, open Phone Link, select "Link your phone and PC", and scan the QR code.
Grant the requested Android permissions to allow Phone Link to access your phone's features like messages, calls, photos, and notifications.
You can now use your PC to make/take calls, send/receive texts, view photos, and manage notifications from your linked Android phone.
For more control, you can use apps like AirDroid Personal, TeamViewer Quick Support, ApowerMirror, or Scrcpy. These allow full remote control of your Android from the PC, even over WiFi.
To use your Android camera as a webcam in any Windows app, make sure you have the latest Windows Insider build. Grant the required permissions and your Android camera will work as a webcam.
