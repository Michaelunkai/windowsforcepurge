Here's the corrected one-liner that will work:schtasks /create /tn "CleanMemTray" /tr "F:\backup\windowsapps\installed\CleanMem\Mini_Monitor.exe" /sc onstart /rl highest /ru system /fIf you want to run both the Mini Monitor and CleanMem, use two separate commands:schtasks /create /tn "CleanMemTray" /tr "F:\backup\windowsapps\installed\CleanMem\Mini_Monitor.exe" /sc onstart /rl highest /ru system /f; schtasks /create /tn "CleanMemClean" /tr "F:\backup\windowsapps\installed\CleanMem\CleanMem.exe" /sc onstart /rl highest /ru system /fThe Mini_Monitor.exe automatically runs in the system tray area and handles memory cleaning without opening any GUI windows. This is exactly what you need for a minimized startup experience.To verify it worked:schtasks /query /tn "CleanMemTray"The task will now start automatically when Windows boots and run completely in the background with just a tray icon.
