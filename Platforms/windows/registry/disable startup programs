Step 1: Open Registry Editor

Press Win + R on your keyboard to open the Run dialog.

Type regedit and press Enter or click OK.

Step 2: Navigate to the Startup Programs Key

In Registry Editor, navigate to either of the following keys based on your preference:

For Current User: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

For All Users: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

Step 3: Identify the Programs to Disable

In the right pane, you'll see a list of programs that are set to run at startup. Each entry represents a program that starts automatically when you log in to Windows.

Carefully review the list and identify the programs you want to disable. Make sure you only disable programs that you are certain you don't need at startup.

Step 4: Disable Startup Programs

To disable a startup program, follow these steps:

Right-click on the entry corresponding to the program you want to disable.
Select Delete from the context menu.
Confirm the deletion if prompted.
Step 5: Confirm Changes and Exit

After you've deleted the entries for the programs you want to disable, close Registry Editor.

Step 6: Restart Your Computer

It's essential to restart your computer for the changes to take effect. This ensures that the disabled programs won't start automatically during the next boot.

Note:

Exercise caution when modifying the registry. Deleting the wrong entries can cause issues with your system.
Always make sure to back up the registry before making any changes.
If you're unsure about disabling a particular program, it's safer to leave it enabled or use other methods like Task Manager or System Configuration Utility (msconfig) to manage startup programs.

with powershell:



Step 1: Open PowerShell with Administrator Privileges

Right-click on the Start button and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" from the menu to open PowerShell with administrator privileges.

Step 2: List Startup Programs

To view the list of startup programs, you can use the Get-Item cmdlet in PowerShell. Run the following command:


Get-ItemProperty -Path "Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"


This command will display a list of startup programs along with their associated registry keys and values.

Step 3: Identify the Programs to Disable

Review the list of startup programs and identify the ones you want to disable. Take note of their names or registry keys.

Step 4: Disable Startup Programs

To disable a startup program, you can use the Remove-ItemProperty cmdlet in PowerShell. Run the following command:


Remove-ItemProperty -Path "Registry::HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "ProgramName"


Replace "ProgramName" with the name of the program you want to disable.

Repeat this command for each program you want to disable.

Step 5: Confirm Changes

After disabling the startup programs, you can verify that they have been removed from the startup list by re-running the Get-ItemProperty command from Step 2.

Step 6: Restart Your Computer

It's essential to restart your computer for the changes to take effect. This ensures that the disabled programs won't start automatically during the next boot.

Note:

Make sure to run PowerShell with administrator privileges to modify the registry.
Exercise caution when modifying the registry. Deleting the wrong entries can cause issues with your system.
Always make sure to back up the registry before making any changes.
If you're unsure about disabling a particular program, it's safer to leave it enabled or use other methods like Task Manager or System Configuration Utility (msconfig) to manage startup programs.



Step 7: Disable Startup Programs for Current User

To disable startup programs specifically for the current user, you can use the Get-Item and Remove-ItemProperty cmdlets in PowerShell. Follow these steps:

Step 7a: List Startup Programs for Current User

Run the following command to list startup programs for the current user:

Get-ItemProperty -Path "Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"
This command will display a list of startup programs specific to the current user.

Step 7b: Identify and Disable Programs

Identify the programs you want to disable from the list obtained in Step 7a.

Step 7c: Disable Startup Programs

To disable a startup program for the current user, use the Remove-ItemProperty cmdlet. Run the following command:

Remove-ItemProperty -Path "Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" -Name "ProgramName"


Replace "ProgramName" with the name of the program you want to disable.
Repeat this command for each program you want to disable.

Step 7d: Confirm Changes

Verify that the disabled programs have been removed from the startup list by re-running the Get-ItemProperty command from Step 7a.

Step 7e: Restart Your Computer

Restart your computer to apply the changes, ensuring that the disabled programs won't start automatically during the next boot.

Note:

PowerShell commands for modifying startup programs work similarly for both the current user and all users. The difference lies in the registry path used (HKEY_CURRENT_USER vs. HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE).
Always exercise caution when modifying the registry, and ensure you have appropriate permissions to make changes.
Consider backing up the registry before making any changes to revert in case of unexpected issues.
It's recommended to disable only the programs you are sure you don't need at startup to avoid potential system instability.
