To make **Parsec** use only the dummy display you created, follow these steps:

---

### **1. Identify the Dummy Display**
After setting up the dummy display, you need to confirm that Windows recognizes it.

1. Open **Display Settings**:
   - Right-click on the desktop and select **Display settings**.

2. Identify your displays:
   - You will see multiple displays (e.g., Display 1, Display 2).
   - Use the **Identify** button to determine which is the dummy display.

3. Set the dummy display as **"Main Display"**:
   - Select the dummy display.
   - Scroll down and check **"Make this my main display"** under "Multiple displays."

---

### **2. Configure Parsec to Use the Dummy Display**
1. Open **Parsec** on your laptop.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Host**.
3. Scroll to the **Monitor** section and select the dummy display:
   - The dummy display will appear as one of the monitors listed.
   - Select the dummy display from the dropdown menu.

---

### **3. Launch the Game on the Dummy Display**
1. Run the game and ensure it launches on the dummy display:
   - If the game opens on the main screen, use the keyboard shortcut `Win + Shift + Left/Right Arrow` to move it to the dummy display.
   - For fullscreen games, configure the game settings to launch on the dummy display.

### **4. Stream with Parsec**
1. On your smartphone, connect to the laptop using the **Parsec client**.
2. Verify the stream:
   - Parsec should now stream only the content displayed on the dummy monitor.
   - The main screen of your laptop will remain unaffected.

### **5. Optional: Disable Main Display Streaming**
To ensure the main display is never streamed:
1. Go to **Parsec Settings** > **Host**.
2. Enable the **"Restrict mouse and keyboard input"** option.
3. Confirm that only the dummy display is shared.

---

By following these steps, you can ensure that Parsec exclusively uses the dummy display for streaming, providing a seamless and independent gaming experience.
