pip3 install gpiozero



 Create a GPIO Test Script
Create a Python Script

Create a Python script to test GPIO functionality. This script will turn an LED on and off on a specific GPIO pin.

 
 
nano test_gpio.py
Paste the following code into test_gpio.py and save the file:

 
 
# test_gpio.py
from gpiozero import LED
from time import sleep

# Initialize LED on GPIO pin 17
led = LED(17)

print("Turning LED on...")
led.on()
sleep(5)  # Keep LED on for 5 seconds

print("Turning LED off...")
led.off()
Step 7: Run the GPIO Test Script
Execute the script to test GPIO functionality.

 
 
 3 test_gpio.py
Step 8: Verify GPIO Functionality Using Command-Line Tools
If you prefer command-line utilities, you can use raspi-gpio to check the status of GPIO pins.

Install raspi-gpio

If not already installed, install the raspi-gpio utility.

 
 
apt-get install -y raspi-gpio
Check GPIO Pin Status

Display the current state of all GPIO pins.

 
 
raspi-gpio get
