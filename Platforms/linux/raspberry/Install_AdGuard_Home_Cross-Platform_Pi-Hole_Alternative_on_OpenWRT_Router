Install AdGuard Home Cross-Platform Pi-Hole Alternative on OpenWRT Router
What is AdGuard Home?
AdGuard Home is a network-wide software for blocking ads and tracking. After you set it up, it'll cover ALL your home devices, and you don't need any client-side software for that.

It operates as a DNS server that re-routes tracking domains to a “black hole”, thus preventing your devices from connecting to those servers. It's based on software we use for our public AdGuard DNS servers, and both share a lot of code. -https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardHome
