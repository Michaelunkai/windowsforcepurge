Setup Pi-Hole as a Recursive DNS Server with Unbound
Installing and Configuring Unbound
Run the following commands in a terminal window:
# install unbound
sudo apt install unbound
# update root hints file
wget https://www.internic.net/domain/named.root -qO- | sudo tee /var/lib/unbound/root.hints
# edit unbound configuration
sudo nano /etc/unbound/unbound.conf.d/pi-hole.conf
Paste the following configuration into pi-hole.conf
server:
    # If no logfile is specified, syslog is used
    # logfile: "/var/log/unbound/unbound.log"
    verbosity: 0

    interface: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5335
    do-ip4: yes
    do-udp: yes
    do-tcp: yes

    # May be set to yes if you have IPv6 connectivity
    do-ip6: no

    # You want to leave this to no unless you have *native* IPv6. With 6to4 and
    # Terredo tunnels your web browser should favor IPv4 for the same reasons
    prefer-ip6: no

    # Use this only when you downloaded the list of primary root servers!
    # If you use the default dns-root-data package, unbound will find it automatically
    #root-hints: "/var/lib/unbound/root.hints"

    # Trust glue only if it is within the server's authority
    harden-glue: yes

    # Require DNSSEC data for trust-anchored zones, if such data is absent, the zone becomes BOGUS
    harden-dnssec-stripped: yes

    # Don't use Capitalization randomization as it known to cause DNSSEC issues sometimes
    # see https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/unbound-stubby-or-dnscrypt-proxy/9378 for further details
    use-caps-for-id: no

    # Reduce EDNS reassembly buffer size.
    # Suggested by the unbound man page to reduce fragmentation reassembly problems
    edns-buffer-size: 1472

    # Perform prefetching of close to expired message cache entries
    # This only applies to domains that have been frequently queried
    prefetch: yes

    # One thread should be sufficient, can be increased on beefy machines. In reality for most users running on small networks or on a single machine, it should be unnecessary to seek performance enhancement by increasing num-threads above 1.
    num-threads: 1

    # Ensure kernel buffer is large enough to not lose messages in traffic spikes
    so-rcvbuf: 1m

    # Ensure privacy of local IP ranges
    private-address: 192.168.0.0/16
    private-address: 169.254.0.0/16
    private-address: 172.16.0.0/12
    private-address: 10.0.0.0/8
    private-address: fd00::/8
    private-address: fe80::/10

Press CTRL+O, Enter, CTRL+X to write the changes to pi-hole.conf
Continue with the following commands in terminal
# restart the unbound service
sudo service unbound restart
# test a DNS lookup via unbound
dig github.io @127.0.0.1 -p 5335
Back in the web browser, navigate back to the Pi-Hole web interface
Log in if you are not already
Select Settings > DNS
Uncheck any of the previously selected upstream DNS servers
Check the box next to Custom 1 (IPv4)
Enter 127.0.0.1#5335 as the address
Scroll down and click the Save button
Testing the Changes
Open a new tab in the web browser and navigate to https://yahoo.com
Go back into Pi-Hole and select Query Log from the left navigation
Filter the results on www.yahoo.com
You should see entries showing the DNS requests forwarding to localhost#5335
