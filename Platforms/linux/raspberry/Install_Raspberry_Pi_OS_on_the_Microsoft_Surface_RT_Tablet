Install Raspberry Pi OS on the Microsoft Surface RT Tablet
Disclaimer
This process will overwrite the current Windows 8 RT operating system on the Surface RT tablet. I have tested these steps on my own device (as shown in this video), but I am not responsible if you damage or brick your device. Verify this process will work on your device before starting and make sure to backup any data you do not want to lose before proceeding.

Write the Raspberry Pi OS image to USB flash drive
Once the write completes, open the readable partition on the USB flash drive
From the previous downloads, copy the EFI folder, startup.nsh, zImage and the device tree (.dtb) file to the readable partition on the USB flash drive
Open startup.nsh in a text editor
Replace the contents of the file with the following
fs0:
zImage dtb=tegra30-microsoft-surface-rt-efi.dtb root=/dev/sda2 rootwait console=tty0 cpuidle.off=1

# shutdown if something went wrong
reset -s

Copy the contents of the extracted folder to the corresponding location in the root Linux directory
Reboot the Surface RT tablet
At this point, you can continue running Raspberry Pi OS from the flash drive, or install it to the internal eMMC storage, replacing the stock Windows 8 RT operating system
Installing Raspberry Pi OS to eMMC Internal Storage
ðŸš¨ WARNING: Continuing beyond this point will format the storage on the Surface RT tablet and all files and the Windows 8 RT operating system will be lost
