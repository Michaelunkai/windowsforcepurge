Customize Star ip
Starship is highly customizable. You can create a configuration file to customize its behavior and appearance.

Create the configuration file:

 
 
touch ~/.config/star ip.toml
Open the configuration file in a text editor:

 
 
nano ~/.config/star ip.toml
Add your custom configuration. Here is an example configuration:

toml
 
# ~/.config/star ip.toml

# Customize the prompt
[prompt]
add_newline = false
format = "$all"

# Customize the prompt character
[character]
symbol = "âžœ"
Save and close the file.

For more customization options, you can refer to the official Starship Configuration documentation.
