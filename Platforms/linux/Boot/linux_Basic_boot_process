Basic boot procmkinitrd: A command to create an initial RAM disk (initrd) image containing necessary modules and drivers to boot a Linux system, particularly helpful for systems with complex storage setups.ess: The sequence of steps a computer follows when it starts up, including power-on self-test (POST), loading of BIOS or UEFI firmware, locating and executing the bootloader, loading the operating system kernel, and initializing system components.

Basic Input/Output System (BIOS): A firmware interface used during the initial booting process to initialize hardware components, perform a POST, and provide basic input/output services for the operating system. It's being replaced by UEFI in modern systems.

Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI): A modern firmware interface replacing BIOS, providing advanced boot features like secure boot, support for large storage devices, network booting, and a graphical interface. UEFI offers more flexibility and security compared to BIOS.


Commands:


mkinitrd: A command to create an initial RAM disk (initrd) image containing necessary modules and drivers to boot a Linux system, particularly helpful for systems with complex storage setups.

grub2-install: Command to install the GRUB2 bootloader onto a disk or partition, allowing the system to boot into the installed operating system.

grub2-mkconfig: Generates the GRUB2 configuration file based on the detected operating systems and boot parameters.

grub2-update: Updates the GRUB2 bootloader configuration to reflect changes made to the system's boot configuration or installed kernels.

dracut: A tool used to generate initramfs (initial RAM file system) images in Linux, containing necessary drivers and modules for booting the system, especially useful in situations where mkinitrd isn't suitable.

initrd.img: An initial RAM disk image containing essential drivers and modules needed during the boot process for Linux systems, generated by utilities like mkinitrd or dracut.

vmlinuz: The compressed Linux kernel image containing the core components of the operating system. It's loaded into memory during the boot process and executed to start the Linux operating system.

Grand Unified Bootloader version 2 (GRUB2): A flexible and widely used bootloader for Linux and other Unix-like systems. It allows users to select and boot different operating systems or kernels installed on the system and supports various boot configurations.

Boot sources:

Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE): A protocol allowing a computer to boot over a network, retrieving its operating system from a server instead of local storage, commonly used in diskless environments or for deploying operating systems remotely.

Booting from Universal Serial Bus (USB): The process of starting a computer using an operating system stored on a USB flash drive, offering portability and flexibility for system maintenance or installation.

Booting from ISO: Starting a computer directly from an ISO image file, typically used for installing or running operating systems without the need for physical media like DVDs or USB drives.
