On Kali Linux, SSH should already be installed, but you can start and enable it as well:

 

sudo service ssh start
sudo systemctl enable ssh



Accessing Metasploitable 2 from Kali Linux:

    You can now use SSH (if enabled) or other tools to access Metasploitable 2 from Kali Linux. For example, if SSH is enabled on Metasploitable 2 and you know the Metasploitable 2 username and password, you can SSH into it from Kali Linux:

Check If SSH Service is Running:

To check if the SSH service is running, you can use the ps command to look for the SSH daemon process:



ps aux | grep sshd

This command will show if the SSH daemon is running.

Restart SSH Service Directly:

If the SSH service is running and you want to restart it, you can use the /etc/init.d/ script directly. Use one of the following commands based on the name of the SSH service on Metasploitable 2 (it might be ssh or sshd):

For example, if the service name is ssh:



sudo /etc/init.d/s  restart

If the service name is sshd:



sudo /etc/init.d/s d restart

This command will restart the SSH service without using the service command.

Verify SSH Service Status:

After restarting the SSH service, you can verify its status to ensure it's running as expected:



ps aux | grep sshd

You should see the SSH daemon process in the output, indicating that the SSH service is running.
