Web fuzzing is a security testing technique that involves sending random or unexpected data to web applications to discover vulnerabilities. By analyzing the application's responses, testers can identify weaknesses like unhandled exceptions, SQL injection points, and cross-site scripting (XSS) flaws, helping to enhance the application's security.










Web Fuzzing with ffuf on Kali Linux
Step-by-Step Tutorial
Step 1: Install ffuf
Install ffuf fuzzing tool on your Kali Linux.

sudo apt update
Updates the package list for upgrades.


sudo apt install ffuf
Installs the ffuf fuzzing tool.

Step 2: Install seclists
Install seclists wordlist package for security assessments.

sudo apt install seclists
Installs the seclists package with wordlists.

Step 3: Using ffuf with seclists
Use ffuf and seclists to fuzz web applications.

Enumerate Directories:

ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ
Fuzzes directories on the target web application.

Filter Out Empty Responses:

ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ -fs 0
Filters out responses with size 0 bytes.

Discover PHP Files:

ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ.php -mc 200
Discovers PHP files with HTTP status code 200.

Step 4: Advanced Fuzzing Techniques
Fuzz Multiple Parts of the URL:

ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt:/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/file-extensions.txt -u http://example.com/FUZZ1.FUZZ2
Fuzzes file names and their extensions.

Fuzz GET Parameters:

ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt -u http://example.com/page?FUZZ=1 -fs 691
Fuzzes GET parameters and filters noise responses.

Fuzz POST Parameters:

ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/burp-parameter-names.txt -u http://example.com/page -X POST -d "FUZZ=value" -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
Fuzzes POST parameters with specified payload data.

Step 5: Fuzzing Subdomains
Direct Subdomain Fuzzing:

ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u http://FUZZ.example.com
Enumerates subdomains directly on the target.

Virtual Host Fuzzing:

ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -u http://example.com -H "Host: FUZZ.example.com"
Fuzzes subdomains using the Host header.

Conclusion
This tutorial guides you through installing and using ffuf with seclists on Kali Linux for web fuzzing. It covers basic and advanced usage to discover directories, files, and parameters in web applications. Always ensure you have authorization before fuzzing any web application
