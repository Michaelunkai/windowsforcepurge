#check ol external drives & their partitions and size:
lsblk -o NAME,TYPE,SIZE,MOUNTPOINT | grep -E 'sd.|hd.|vd.|^NAME.*disk$'

#format the external drive and assign it to a letter (f):
sudo mkfs.ext4 -L f /dev/sdX


#If you want to combine or merge partitions sda1 and sda2 into a single partition:
sudo umount /dev/sda1
sudo umount /dev/sda2


sudo parted /dev/sda
(parted) rm 1
(parted) rm 2
(parted) quit


#Create a New Partition: Recreate a single partition spanning the entire drive, ensuring it uses the entire available space:
sudo parted /dev/sda
(parted) mkpart primary ext4 0% 100%
(parted) quit

sudo mkfs.ext4 -L f /dev/sda1
