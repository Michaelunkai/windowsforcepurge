 Deploy Your Blog
If you want to deploy your blog, you can set up deployment configurations in _config.yml. For example, you can deploy to GitHub Pages:

 
 
deploy:
  type: 'git'
  repo: 'https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepository.git'
  branch: 'gh-pages'
Then, install the deployer plugin:

 
 
npm install hexo-deployer-git --save
Finally, deploy your site with:

 
 
hexo deploy
