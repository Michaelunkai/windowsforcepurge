### How to Set Up and Use Hugo in Ubuntu: A Step-by-Step Guide

**Step 1: Update and Upgrade Your System**

Before you begin, ensure your system is up to date.

  
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

**Step 2: Install Hugo**

You can install Hugo via APT by adding the Hugo repository:

  
sudo apt install -y hugo

**Step 3: Verify the Installation**

Ensure Hugo is installed correctly by checking the version:

  
hugo version

**Step 4: Create a New Hugo Site**

Now, create a new Hugo site in your desired directory:

  
hugo new site my-hugo-site

Navigate to your new Hugo site directory:

  
cd my-hugo-site

**Step 5: Add a Theme**

Hugo uses themes to style your site. You can add a theme from the official Hugo themes repository. For example:

  
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git themes/ananke
echo 'theme = "ananke"' >> config.toml

**Step 6: Create Content**

Create a new post or page:

  
hugo new posts/my-first-post.md

This command creates a new Markdown file in the `content/posts` directory where you can edit your content.

**Step 7: Start the Hugo Server**

To preview your site, start the Hugo server:

  
hugo server -D

This command will start a local server, and you can view your site in a web browser at `http://localhost:1313`.

**Step 8: Build the Site**

When you're ready to build your site for production, use the following command:

  
hugo

This will generate the static site files in the `public` directory, which you can then upload to your web server.

**Step 9: Deploy Your Hugo Site**

You can deploy your Hugo site by copying the contents of the `public` directory to your web server.

For example, using `rsync`:

  
rsync -avz public/ user@yourserver.com:/path/to/your/site/

**Step 10: Customize and Extend**

You can further customize your Hugo site by editing the configuration files and adding more content, plugins, and custom themes as needed.

This guide should help you get started with Hugo on Ubuntu. Enjoy building your static websites!
