4. **Minimalistic and Fast**: Eleventy is designed to be fast and lightweight, with minimal dependencies. It focuses on simplicity and performance.

5. **Extensible**: While Eleventy works out-of-the-box, it is also highly customizable. You can create custom plugins, filters, and shortcodes to extend its functionality.

6. **Content-Powered**: Eleventy is content-first, meaning it emphasizes content creation and management. It doesn't require a complex setup or configuration to get started.

7. **Free and Open-Source**: Eleventy is open-source software, which means it's free to use and you can contribute to its development.
