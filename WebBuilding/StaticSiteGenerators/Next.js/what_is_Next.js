**Next.js** is a popular React framework for building web applications. It extends React's capabilities by providing features such as server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes, which help create performant and SEO-friendly web applications. Next.js simplifies the development process by managing routing, code splitting, and optimized image handling out of the box.

### What You Can Do in the Web UI:

1. **Build Dynamic Websites**: Use React components to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

2. **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Fetch data on the server before rendering the page, improving SEO and performance for pages that rely on dynamic content.

3. **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-render pages at build time, delivering fast and highly optimized static websites.

4. **API Routes**: Build and serve API endpoints directly within your Next.js application, eliminating the need for a separate backend.

5. **Image Optimization**: Automatically optimize images for faster loading using the built-in Next.js Image component.

6. **Customizable Routing**: Utilize file-based routing to easily manage and create new pages by simply adding files to the `pages` directory.

7. **Support for CSS and Sass**: Style your application with CSS, Sass, or CSS-in-JS solutions with built-in support.

8. **Internationalization (i18n)**: Create multilingual applications with built-in internationalization features.

9. **Middleware**: Add custom logic like authentication checks to requests with middleware.

10. **Deploy with Vercel**: Seamlessly deploy your Next.js app to Vercel, the company behind Next.js, for optimal performance and scalability.

These features make Next.js a versatile framework for creating everything from small personal blogs to large-scale enterprise applications.
