**Detailed Comparison**

1. **Architecture and Scalability**
   - **Apache Solr:** Solr can be run in standalone mode or in SolrCloud mode. SolrCloud is a distributed search engine architecture that provides fault tolerance and scalability by distributing data across multiple nodes.
   - **Elasticsearch:** Elasticsearch is designed from the ground up as a distributed system. It uses a peer-to-peer architecture where each node is capable of handling requests, indexing, and searching data. It automatically handles data distribution and replication.

2. **Data Handling and Flexibility**
   - **Apache Solr:** Solr uses a schema-based approach where fields and types are defined in a schema.xml file. It supports dynamic fields, but the schema needs to be updated for new fields.
   - **Elasticsearch:** Elasticsearch uses a schema-free approach where mappings are dynamically inferred. It supports dynamic mapping, making it more flexible for handling evolving data structures.

3. **Query Capabilities**
   - **Apache Solr:** Solr offers rich query capabilities with various query parsers including the DisMax and Extended DisMax query parsers. It supports advanced text analysis, faceting, and filtering.
   - **Elasticsearch:** Elasticsearch provides a powerful Query DSL (Domain Specific Language) for building complex queries. It supports full-text search, structured search, and aggregations for advanced analytics.

4. **Integration and Ecosystem**
   - **Apache Solr:** Solr integrates well with the Apache ecosystem, especially with Hadoop for big data applications. It also has built-in support for data import handlers.
   - **Elasticsearch:** Elasticsearch is a core component of the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). It integrates seamlessly with Logstash for data ingestion and Kibana for visualization.

5. **Community and Support**
   - **Apache Solr:** Solr has a large community of users and contributors. It is maintained by the Apache Software Foundation, ensuring open-source governance and community-driven development.
   - **Elasticsearch:** Elasticsearch has a large user base and is backed by Elastic NV, a company that offers commercial support, managed services, and additional features through Elastic Cloud.
