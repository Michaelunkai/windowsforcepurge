Automating Multiple Dorks
If you want to automate running multiple dorks, you can create a script or use a loop in your terminal. Here is an example using a shell script:

Create a Shell Script:
Open a new file with nano:

 
 
nano run_dorks. 
Add the following content to the file:

 
 
#!/bin/ 

dorks=(
    "inurl:admin"
    "site:.gov filetype:pdf"
    "intitle:index.of"
)

for dork in "${dorks[@]}"; do
    python3 dorkify.py -d "$dork"
done
Save and close the file (Ctrl+O to save, Ctrl+X to exit).

Make the Script Executable:

 
 
chmod +x run_dorks. 
Run the Script:

 
 
./run_dorks.
