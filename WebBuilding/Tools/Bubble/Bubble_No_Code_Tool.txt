No-code tools like Bubble allow users to build web applications without writing code. Bubble provides a visual interface where users can drag and drop elements to create their application's user interface, define workflows for how the app should behave, and set up data structures to manage information. This makes it possible for people without programming experience to create complex applications. Key features include:
- Visual Design: Build responsive layouts using a drag-and-drop editor.
- Workflow Management: Define actions and events to control how the app responds to user interactions.
- Database Integration: Create and manage databases directly within the tool.
- Third-Party Integrations: Connect with APIs and external services to extend functionality.
- Deployment: Easily deploy and host the application on Bubble's infrastructure.
Bubble is popular for prototyping, MVPs, and even full-fledged applications.
