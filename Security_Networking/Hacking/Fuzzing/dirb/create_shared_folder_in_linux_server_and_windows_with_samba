Install Samba on Ubuntu Server:

 
 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba
Create a Shared Directory:

 
 
sudo mkdir -p /srv/samba/shared
sudo chmod 2775 /srv/samba/shared
sudo chown nobody:nogroup /srv/samba/shared
Configure Samba:
Edit the Samba configuration file:

 
 
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
Add the following lines at the end of the file:

ini
 
[ ared]
path = /srv/samba/ ared
browseable = yes
read only = no
guest ok = yes
force user = nobody
Save and exit the editor (Ctrl+X, then Y, and Enter).

Restart Samba Service:

 
 
sudo systemctl restart smbd
On Windows 11
Open File Explorer and Map Network Drive:

Open File Explorer.
Click on "This PC" in the left sidebar.
Click on the "Map network drive" button in the ribbon at the top.
Map the Shared Folder:

Choose a drive letter from the dropdown menu.
In the "Folder" field, enter the IP address of your Ubuntu server and the name of the shared folder:
 
 
\\<Ubuntu_Server_IP>\ ared
Replace <Ubuntu_Server_IP> with the actual IP address of your Ubuntu server.
Connect to the Shared Folder:

Check the box "Connect using different credentials."
Click "Fini ."
When prompted, enter the credentials:
Username: nobody
Password: (leave it blank)
Now, you should be able to access the shared folder from your Windows 11 laptop.

Additional Notes
Ensure that your Ubuntu server and Windows 11 laptop are on the same network.
If you face any issues with permissions, you might need to adjust the Samba configuration or folder permissions accordingly.
If you need the shared folder to be more secure, you can create specific Samba users and configure permissions as needed.
