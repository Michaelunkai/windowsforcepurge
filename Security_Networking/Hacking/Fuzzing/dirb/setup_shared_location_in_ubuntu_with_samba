Update and Upgrade: After installing Ubuntu (or your chosen distribution), launch it and run the following commands to update and upgrade the system:

 
 
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
Install Samba: Next, install Samba, which is the software that allows for file sharing between Linux and Windows systems:

 
sudo apt install samba
Configure Samba: Once Samba is installed, you'll need to configure it. Open the Samba configuration file using a text editor like Nano:

 
 
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
In the [global] section of the configuration file, add the following lines to set up your workgroup (replace YOUR_WORKGROUP with your desired workgroup name):

 
 
workgroup = YOUR_WORKGROUP
Then, at the bottom of the file, add the configuration for your shared folder. For example:

 
 
[ ared]
    path = /mnt/ ared
    read only = no
    guest ok = yes
This configuration sets up a shared folder named "shared" located at /mnt/shared. Adjust the path and permissions as needed.

Create Shared Folder: Create the shared folder on your Linux filesystem and adjust permissions accordingly:

 
 
sudo mkdir /mnt/ ared
sudo chmod 777 /mnt/shared
Restart Samba Service: After configuring Samba, restart the Samba service to apply the changes:

 
sudo service smbd restart
Access Shared Folder from Windows: Finally, on your Windows machine, open File Explorer and navigate to \\<WSL2_IP_Address>\shared (replace <WSL2_IP_Address> with the IP address of your WSL2 instance). You should see the shared folder and be able to access it like any other network share.
