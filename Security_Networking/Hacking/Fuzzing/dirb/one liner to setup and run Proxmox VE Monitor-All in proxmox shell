Description
This script will add Monitor-All to Proxmox VE, which will monitor the status of all your instances, both containers and virtual machines, excluding templates and user-defined ones, and automatically restart or reset them if they become unresponsive. This is particularly useful if you're experiencing problems with Home Assistant becoming non-responsive every few days/weeks. Monitor-All also maintains a log of the entire process, which can be helpful for troubleshooting and monitoring purposes. ðŸ›ˆ Virtual machines without the QEMU guest agent installed must be excluded. ðŸ›ˆ Prior to generating any new CT/VM not found in this repository, it's necessary to halt Proxmox VE Monitor-All by running systemctl stop ping-instances.
