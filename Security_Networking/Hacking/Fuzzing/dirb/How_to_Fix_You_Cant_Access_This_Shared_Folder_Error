How to Fix "You Can't Access This Shared Folder" Error
If you're encountering the error message "You can't access this shared folder because your organization's security policies block unauthenticated guest access," follow these steps to resolve the issue.

Step 1: Configure the Ubuntu Samba Server
Edit the Samba configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
Add or modify the following lines in the [global] section:

[global]
map to guest = Bad User
Create a share definition for the folder you want to share:

[ ared_folder]
path = /path/to/your/folder
available = yes
valid users = your_username
read only = no
browsable = yes
public = yes
writable = yes
guest ok = yes
Replace /path/to/your/folder with the actual path to your shared folder and your_username with your Ubuntu username.

Save and close the file:
Press Ctrl+X, then Y, and then Enter.

Restart the Samba services:

sudo systemctl restart smbd
sudo systemctl restart nmbd
Step 2: Modify Windows Group Policy Settings
Open the Group Policy Editor:
Press Win + R, type gpedit.msc, and press Enter.

Navigate to the following path:

Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Network -> Lanman Workstation
Double-click on Enable insecure guest logons.

Set it to Enabled.

Click OK and close the Group Policy Editor.

Step 3: Enable Guest Access in Windows Registry
Open the Registry Editor:
Press Win + R, type regedit, and press Enter.

Navigate to the following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters
Double-click on the AllowInsecureGuestAuth entry.

If the entry does not exist, create it by right-clicking on the right pane, selecting New -> DWORD (32-bit) Value, and naming it AllowInsecureGuestAuth.
Set the value to 1 and click OK.

Close the Registry Editor.

Step 4: Reboot Your Windows Machine
Reboot your Windows machine to apply the changes.

After following these steps, try accessing the shared folder again. You should be able to connect without seeing the error message.
