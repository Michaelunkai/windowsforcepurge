To access a Samba shared folder from your Ubuntu server, you can use the smbclient command-line utility or mount the share using the cifs filesystem. Hereâ€™s how to do it using both methods:

Method 1: Using smbclient
Install smbclient if it's not already installed:

 
 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install smbclient
Access the Samba share:

 
 
smbclient //hostname/sharename -U username
Replace hostname with the IP address or hostname of your Ubuntu desktop, sharename with the name of the shared folder, and username with the Samba username.

Navigate and interact with the shared folder using smbclient commands. For example:

 
 
smb: \> ls
smb: \> get filename
smb: \> put localfile
Method 2: Mounting the Share
Install CIFS utilities if not already installed:

 
 
sudo apt update
sudo apt install cifs-utils
Create a mount point on your Ubuntu server:

 
 
sudo mkdir /mnt/samba_ are
Mount the Samba share using the mount command:

 
 
sudo mount -t cifs //hostname/sharename /mnt/samba_share -o username=username,password=password
Replace hostname with the IP address or hostname of your Ubuntu desktop, sharename with the name of the shared folder, and username and password with the Samba username and password.

Access the mounted share:

 
 
cd /mnt/samba_ are
ls
Automate Mounting at Boot
To automatically mount the Samba share at boot, you can add an entry to the /etc/fstab file.

Edit the fstab file:

 
 
sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add the following line to the end of the file:

 
//hostname/sharename /mnt/samba_share cifs username=username,password=password,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm 0 0
Adjust hostname, sharename, username, and password as needed.

Save and close the file (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter).

Test the fstab entry:

 
 
sudo mount -a
Now, the Samba share will be automatically mounted on boot.
