### Real-World Examples of Big Data and Their Impact on Various Industries

1. **Stock Exchanges:**
   - The New York Stock Exchange is a prime example of Big Data, generating about one terabyte of new trade data daily.

2. **Social Media:**
   - Platforms like Facebook handle over 500 terabytes of data every day, created by photo and video uploads, message exchanges, and user comments.

3. **Aviation:**
   - Jet engines produce over 10 terabytes of data during just 30 minutes of flight, accumulating to several petabytes from thousands of flights each day.

### In-Depth Analysis of Big Data Types: Structured, Unstructured, and Semi-Structured Data with Data Management Examples

**Big Data is classified into three main types:**

1. **Structured Data:**
   - Structured data is stored, accessed, and processed in a fixed format. An example of this is data stored in relational database management systems, such as an Employee table in a database.

2. **Unstructured Data:**
   - Unstructured data lacks a predefined form or structure. Examples include heterogeneous data sources with text files, images, and videos, such as the output from Google Search.

3. **Semi-Structured Data:**
   - Semi-structured data is partially structured but does not conform to strict data models, such as data represented in an XML file.
