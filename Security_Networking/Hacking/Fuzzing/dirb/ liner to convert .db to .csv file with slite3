first check what tables exist in the database by running:

sqlite3 gaming20082024.db ".tables"
Once you identify the correct table name (for example, if itâ€™s named games), replace your_table with that name. For instance:

sqlite3 -header -csv gaming20082024.db "SELECT * FROM games;" > gaming20082024.csv
This should export the table data into your CSV file without error.
