**Will Google’s Gemini Live Become a Competitor to ChatGPT?**

With the launch of the new Pixel 9 series—featuring built-in AI capabilities powered by Google’s large language model, Gemini, including call summaries, searchable screenshots, weather summaries, and tools for reimagining images—Google has also introduced 'Gemini Live,' a new voice chat feature. Currently available to all Gemini Advanced users, Gemini Live is set to compete directly with ChatGPT’s 'Advanced Voice Mode,' which was released in May to a limited group of users.

**So, what exactly is Gemini Live?**

Gemini Live responds to questions, adapts when interrupted, pauses conversations, and remembers previous interactions naturally, all without requiring the user to press any buttons. This allows for a more fluid and natural conversation experience. Users can choose from 10 different voices—compared to ChatGPT’s three—created in collaboration with professional actors. However, unlike OpenAI's earlier attempts with celebrities like Scarlett Johansson, Google does not replicate voices outside of this selection.

Despite the clear similarities between Gemini Live and ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, one notable difference is that Google Live cannot yet interpret emotional intonation in conversations, a feature OpenAI has already demonstrated. Google first announced this AI-powered voice feature during its I/O conference in May, where it also mentioned that the feature would eventually include real-time video understanding, enabling users to complete tasks using their camera. However, this capability has yet to materialize.

**What does this mean for competition?**

There’s significant potential for serious competition between Google’s Gemini Live and ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode. With advanced features like broader voice selection and deeper integration with other AI tools within Google’s ecosystem, Gemini Live offers an innovative user experience. However, shortcomings such as the lack of emotional intonation interpretation and the delay in rolling out promised features might hinder its progress. Ultimately, the competitiveness will depend on the usability and development pace of both platforms, but there’s certainly potential for a strong rivalry.
