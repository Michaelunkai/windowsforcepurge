 Use Pulsar in Docker
Pulsar offers a variety of client libraries, such as Java, Go, Python, C++.

If you're running a local standalone cluster, you can use one of these root URLs to interact with your cluster:

pulsar://localhost:6650
http://localhost:8080
The following example guides you to get started with Pulsar by using the Python client API.

Install the Pulsar Python client library directly from PyPI:

pip install pulsar-client

Consume a message
Create a consumer and subscribe to the topic:

import pulsar

client = pulsar.Client('pulsar://localhost:6650')
consumer = client.subscribe('my-topic', subscription_name='my-sub')

while True:
    msg = consumer.receive()
    print("Received message: '%s'" % msg.data())
    consumer.acknowledge(msg)

client.close()


Produce a message
Start a producer to send some test messages:

import pulsar

client = pulsar.Client('pulsar://localhost:6650')
producer = client.create_producer('my-topic')

for i in range(10):
    producer.send(('hello-pulsar-%d' % i).encode('utf-8'))

client.close()
