Introduction
Did you know that you can transcribe any sound file in any language (including Hebrew) in just a few seconds? The combination of Groq and Whisper-3 allows exactly that, and even for free. These are two revolutionary technologies â€“ the first is an AI model that understands language and can turn sound into text (Whisper); the second is groundbreaking technology that allows AI computations to run at incredible speed.
About Groq
Groq is a startup company revolutionizing the world of large language models (LLMs). It developed Language Processing Units (LPUs) that work at high speed thanks to unique memory architecture. These chips use Static RAM (SRAM), which allows faster access to information.
About Whisper-3
Whisper-3 is an open-source speech recognition model developed by OpenAI. It can recognize speech, perform natural language processing, transcribe audio clips, translate into different languages, and detect the spoken language.
The Combination of Groq and Whisper-3
Combining Groq's speed with Whisper-3's capabilities creates a highly intelligent, powerful, and fast transcriber. In the future, anyone will be able to speak with anyone else in their language and understand them intuitively.
Using Whisper-3 on Groq
Here's how to use Whisper-3 on Groq:
1. Go to the Groq playground.
2. Select the Whisper-3 model.
3. Choose the transcription language (Hebrew in our case).
4. Record a speech clip or upload an audio file.
5. Click "Submit" and receive the transcribed file in seconds.
Real-Time Example
A real-time demonstration: I uploaded an 8-minute file to Groq where a client discusses building a voice model. Whisper-3 transcribed the file in just 6 seconds.
