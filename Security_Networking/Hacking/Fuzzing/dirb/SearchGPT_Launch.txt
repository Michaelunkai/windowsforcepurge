SearchGPT Launch by OpenAI: Revolution or Exaggeration?
Yesterday, OpenAI made headlines with the announcement of SearchGPT, which has yet to be launched. Many see it as a historic event that could change the world of search and challenge Google's hegemony. Is it really so?
Points to Consider:
- Google's Dominance in Search Engines: Google has dominated the search engine field for 25 years, with unique expertise that is very difficult to replicate.
- Failed Attempts in the Past: Giant corporations like Microsoft and Yahoo have tried to compete with Google and failed.
- Different Fields of Expertise: OpenAI specializes in AI, not search engines. Despite the similarities, these are very different fields.
- Risk for OpenAI: If SearchGPT does not succeed as expected, it could harm OpenAI's image just as competitors are giving impressive and threatening performances.
Recommendation for Google:
Google should hurry up with the launch of an AI-integrated search engine to maintain its dominance in this emerging niche.
The Big Question:
Can SearchGPT really change the rules of the game, or is this just temporary excitement backed by a lot of media noise?
