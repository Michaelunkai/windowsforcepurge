# Announcement from OpenAI: New API Feature for Structured Text Output with 100% Reliability and the Introduction of the Cheaper GPT-4o Model

A new API feature from OpenAI is here: structured text output according to a predefined format (with 100% reliability).

Have you ever wanted your answer in JSON with specific fields?
Now you no longer need to beg the model not to add "Here's your answer in JSON format!" and mess everything up.
And there's no need to ask it to take a deep breath.

This new service comes with 100% reliability (doesn't rely on the model).
Additionally, the new GPT-4o model is also half the price of the previous one.

## Super Easy!

"100% reliability" may sound crazy, but in reality, it's very easy to get the model to output JSON in a specific predefined structure every time. There are several packages on the internet that do this with any model you want. One particularly simple one is this: [https://github.com/1rgs/jsonformer](https://github.com/1rgs/jsonformer)
