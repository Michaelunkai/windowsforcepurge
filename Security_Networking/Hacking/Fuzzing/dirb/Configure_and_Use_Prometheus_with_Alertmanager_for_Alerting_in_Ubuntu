1)install prometheus
2)install alertmanager
3)run  configure_prometheus_alertmanager. 

Check alerts:
Create a situation that would trigger an alert (e.g., stop a monitored service) and verify that the alert appears in Prometheus and that you receive an alert notification via your configured method (e.g., email).

By following these steps, you should have Prometheus and Alertmanager up and running on your Ubuntu system, configured to send alerts based on your specified rules.
