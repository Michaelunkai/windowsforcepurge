NATS Streaming, now referred to as NATS JetStream, is a messaging system designed for cloud-native applications, providing lightweight, highly performant, and easy-to-use messaging solutions. It is built on top of the NATS messaging system and offers features typically associated with streaming platforms such as:

1. **Durable Message Storage**: Messages can be persisted to disk, ensuring that they are not lost even if the consumer is offline or if there's a system failure.

2. **Message Acknowledgements**: Producers and consumers can acknowledge messages to ensure reliable delivery.

3. **Replay/Replay at a Point in Time**: Consumers can replay messages from a specific point in time or from the beginning, allowing for flexible consumption patterns.

4. **Rate Matching/Flow Control**: Producers can send messages at a rate that matches the consumers' ability to process them, preventing overload.

5. **Scaling and Fault Tolerance**: It supports clustering for horizontal scalability and redundancy, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

6. **Pub/Sub and Queue Groups**: It supports both publish/subscribe and work queue models, making it versatile for different messaging patterns.

7. **Data Retention Policies**: You can configure how long messages are retained based on time or storage limits.

NATS Streaming (JetStream) is often used in scenarios where reliable message delivery and persistence are crucial, such as in microservices architectures, IoT, real-time analytics, and event sourcing systems.
