Sure! Here is the detailed tutorial with expanded titles for each step:

# **Creating and Accessing a Shared Folder Between Windows 11 and Ubuntu Server**

## **Step 1: Creating a Shared Folder on Windows 11**

### **1.1: Create the Folder to Share**

1. Right-click on the desktop or in the desired directory.
2. Select **New > Folder**.
3. Name the folder (e.g., `SharedFolder`).

### **1.2: Share the Folder**

1. Right-click on the folder you created and select **Properties**.
2. Go to the **Sharing** tab and click on **Share...**.
3. In the **Network access** window, select the user you want to share with (e.g., `Everyone`).
4. Click **Add**.
5. Set the permission level (Read/Write) for the selected user.
6. Click **Share** and then **Done**.

### **1.3: Configure Advanced Sharing Options**

1. Still in the folder's properties, go to the **Advanced Sharing...** button.
2. Check the box **Share this folder**.
3. Click on **Permissions** to set the permissions as needed.
4. Click **OK** and **Close**.

### **1.4: Ensure Network Discovery and File Sharing are Enabled**

1. Open the **Control Panel**.
2. Go to **Network and Sharing Center**.
3. Click on **Change advanced sharing settings**.
4. Ensure **Turn on network discovery** and **Turn on file and printer sharing** are selected.
5. Optionally, select **Turn off password protected sharing** if you prefer easier access (this may reduce security).

## **Step 2: Accessing the Shared Folder from Ubuntu Server**

### **2.1: Install CIFS Utilities on Ubuntu**

1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu server.
2. Install CIFS utilities by running:
     
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install cifs-utils

### **2.2: Create a Mount Point on Ubuntu**

1. Create a directory where you will mount the shared folder:
     
   sudo mkdir /mnt/ aredfolder

### **2.3: Mount the Shared Folder**

1. Use the `mount.cifs` command to mount the shared folder. Replace `192.168.1.231` with the IP address of your Windows machine, and `Downloads` with the name of your shared folder:
     
   sudo mount.cifs //192.168.1.231/Downloads /mnt/sharedfolder -o username=micha,password=yourpassword,vers=3.0
   - Note: Ensure the shared folder name (`Downloads`) matches the name set in the sharing properties on Windows.

### **2.4: Verify the Mount**

1. Navigate to the mount point to verify that it is correctly mounted:
     
   cd /mnt/ aredfolder
   ls
   - You should see the contents of your shared folder if the mount is successful.

## **Optional: Automating the Mounting Process on Boot**

### **3.1: Edit the fstab File to Automate Mounting**

1. Open the `/etc/fstab` file in a text editor:
     
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
2. Add the following line at the end of the file to ensure the shared folder mounts on boot:
     
   //192.168.1.231/Downloads /mnt/sharedfolder cifs username=micha,password=password,vers=3.0 0 0
3. Save and close the file (press `Ctrl+O` to save and `Ctrl+X` to exit).

### **3.2: Test the fstab Entry Without Rebooting**

1. To test the fstab entry without rebooting, you can unmount and remount all filesystems:
     
   sudo umount /mnt/ aredfolder
   sudo mount -a
   - Navigate to `/mnt/sharedfolder` to ensure it is mounted correctly.

## **Additional Debugging Steps**

### **4.1: Check Kernel Log Messages for Errors**

1. If you encounter errors, check the kernel log messages for more details:
     
   dmesg | tail

### **4.2: Verify User Permissions**

1. Ensure that the user `micha` has the necessary permissions to access the shared folder.

### **4.3: Recheck Share Path and Network Configuration**

1. Double-check the share path in Windows to ensure it matches the path you are trying to mount.
2. Ensure network configuration settings (like IP address and firewall rules) allow access between your Ubuntu server and Windows machine.

By following these detailed steps, you should be able to successfully create a shared folder on your Windows 11 machine and access it from your Ubuntu server.
