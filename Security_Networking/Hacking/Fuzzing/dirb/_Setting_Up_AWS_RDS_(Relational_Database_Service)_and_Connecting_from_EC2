1. Create an RDS Instance:

Log in to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the RDS dashboard.

Click on "Create database."
Choose the database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server).
Select a use case template or choose the standard create option.
Configure the DB instance details including DB instance identifier, master username, and password.
Choose the DB instance class, storage type, allocated storage, and other settings.
Configure advanced settings such as VPC, subnet group, security group, and backup options.
Review the configuration and click "Create database" to create your RDS instance.
2. Configure Security Group for RDS:

After creating the RDS instance, navigate to the RDS dashboard and select the instance.
Under the "Security" section, click on the associated security group.
Add a new inbound rule to allow inbound traffic on the database port (usually 3306 for MySQL or 5432 for PostgreSQL) from the EC2 instance's security group or specific IP address.
3. Connect to RDS from EC2:

Log in to the EC2 instance using SSH.
Install the required database client (e.g., MySQL client for MySQL, psql for PostgreSQL).
Use the database client to connect to the RDS instance using the endpoint, master username, and password provided during creation.
Test the connection by running SQL queries or commands against the RDS instance.
4. Test Database Connectivity:

Create a sample database, tables, and insert data into them to verify the database connectivity.
Query the database from the EC2 instance to ensure that data can be retrieved and manipulated successfully.
5. Monitor RDS Performance and Usage:

Monitor RDS instance metrics such as CPU utilization, storage usage, and I/O activity in the RDS dashboard.
Set up CloudWatch alarms to notify you of performance issues or resource constraints.
6. Configure Automated Backups and Maintenance (Optional):

Configure automated backups and retention periods to ensure data durability and recovery options.
Set up maintenance windows for automatic patching and updates to the RDS instance.
By following these steps, you'll be able to set up an AWS RDS instance, configure security group settings, connect to the RDS instance from an EC2 instance, test database connectivity, monitor performance, and optionally configure automated backups and maintenance for your database.
