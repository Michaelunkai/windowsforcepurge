Required Components
You will need to install some/all of these before downloading any games (legitimate or pirated!) to stop games crashing due to missing software on your computer:

DirectX
VisualCppRedist AIO
XNA Framework
.NET
To extract games, use either of these two:

7-Zip - for opening 7z/Rar archives.
WinRAR - for opening Rar archives. Has better compatibility with RAR archives. Use this if you have compatibility issues with RAR files, specially for multipart files.
