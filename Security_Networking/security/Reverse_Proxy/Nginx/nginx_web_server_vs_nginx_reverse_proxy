 Here are 10 scenarios where using Nginx as a reverse proxy is preferred:

Load balancing multiple backend servers.
Securing backend servers by hiding their IP addresses.
Caching static content to improve performance.
Handling SSL termination for multiple backend services.
Enabling WebSocket support for backend applications.
Implementing URL rewriting for cleaner URLs.
Offloading SSL encryption to Nginx for backend servers.
Implementing access control and authentication for backend services.
Accelerating content delivery with HTTP/2 support.
Providing a centralized entry point for microservices architecture.
And here are 10 scenarios where using Nginx as a regular web server is preferred:

Hosting a static website with minimal server-side processing.
Serving as a reverse proxy is unnecessary due to a single backend server.
Running a simple web application without the need for complex routing.
Hosting development or testing environments without load balancing needs.
Serving files directly without the need for caching or SSL termination.
Running a lightweight web server for resource-constrained environments.
Deploying a web server for personal projects or small-scale applications.
Hosting API endpoints that don't require reverse proxying to other services.
Handling light traffic websites where performance optimization is not critical.
Simplifying the server setup when the application architecture is straightforward.






 Here's a summary for each scenario:

Reverse Nginx Preferred:

Load balancing multiple servers.
Securing backend IPs.
Caching static content.
SSL termination.
WebSocket support.
URL rewriting.
Access control.
HTTP/2 acceleration.
Microservices entry point.
Regular Nginx Preferred:

Hosting static sites.
Single server.
Simple apps.
No load balancing.
No complex routing.
No caching or SSL termination.
Resource-constrained environments.
Personal projects.
Light traffic.
Straightforward architecture.
