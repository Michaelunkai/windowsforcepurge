Varnish is a web application accelerator, also known as a caching HTTP reverse proxy. It sits in front of a web server and caches HTTP responses to speed up the delivery of content to users. When a user requests a resource, Varnish first checks if the resource is already in its cache. If it is, Varnish serves the cached content directly, reducing the load on the backend server and improving response times. If the resource is not in the cache, Varnish fetches it from the backend server, caches it for future requests, and then serves it to the user.

Key features of Varnish include:

- **High Performance:** It’s designed to handle high traffic loads and deliver content quickly.
- **Flexibility:** Varnish is highly configurable and can be tailored to specific caching needs.
- **Advanced Caching Policies:** It supports various caching strategies and rules to control what gets cached and for how long.
- **Varnish Configuration Language (VCL):** Allows for custom handling of requests and responses with a flexible scripting language.

It’s commonly used in conjunction with web servers like Apache or Nginx to enhance performance and scalability.
