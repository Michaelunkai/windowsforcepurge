### Step-by-Step Tutorial: How to Install, Configure, and Run Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment (AIDE) for File System Integrity Monitoring on Ubuntu Using Cron Automation for Daily Checks

---

#### Step 1: Install AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) on Ubuntu

Start by installing AIDE, which will monitor your file system's integrity.

  
sudo apt install aide -y

#### Step 2: Initialize the AIDE Database to Create a Snapshot of Your File System

Before AIDE can start monitoring, you need to initialize its database. This creates a snapshot of your file system at the current state.

  
sudo aideinit

#### Step 3: Move the AIDE Database to the Default Location for Integrity Checks

Once initialized, move the newly created AIDE database to the default location so it can be used for comparison during integrity checks.

  
sudo mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new /var/lib/aide/aide.db

#### Step 4: Run AIDE to Perform a File System Integrity Check

Now that AIDE is configured, run it to compare the current state of your file system against the database (the baseline).

  
sudo aide --check

This will output any changes that have been made to your file system since the database was initialized.

#### Step 5: Automate AIDE Checks by Scheduling Daily Integrity Checks Using Cron

To automate the integrity checks, you can set up a cron job to run AIDE every day.

1. Open the crontab file:

     
   sudo crontab -e

2. Add the following line to run AIDE checks daily at midnight:

     
   0 0 * * * /usr/bin/aide --check

This will ensure AIDE automatically runs every day and checks the file system for unauthorized or unexpected changes.
