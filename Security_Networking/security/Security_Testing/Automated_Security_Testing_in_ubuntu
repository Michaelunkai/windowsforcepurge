Step 1: Update and Upgrade System
First, ensure your system is up-to-date:

 
 
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
Step 2: Install Required Tools
You will need several tools for automated security testing. Let's start with some essential ones.

2.1. Nmap
Nmap is a network scanner used to discover hosts and services on a computer network.

 
 
sudo apt install nmap -y
2.2. Nikto
Nikto is a web server scanner that performs comprehensive tests against web servers.

 
 
sudo apt install nikto -y
2.3. OpenVAS
OpenVAS is a full-featured vulnerability scanner.

 
 
sudo apt install openvas -y
sudo gvm-setup
After installation, run the following command to check the status:

 
 
sudo gvm-check-setup
Step 3: Install and Configure OWASP ZAP
OWASP ZAP is an open-source web application security scanner.

 
 
sudo apt install snapd -y
sudo snap install zaproxy --classic
Step 4: Automate the Tools Using Scripts
Now, let's create scripts to automate these tools.

4.1. Nmap Script
Create a script nmap_scan.sh:

 
 
nano nmap_scan. 
Add the following content:

 
 
#!/bin/ 
TARGET=$1
nmap -A -T4 $TARGET -oN nmap_scan_results.txt
Make it executable:

 
 
chmod +x nmap_scan. 
4.2. Nikto Script
Create a script nikto_scan.sh:

 
 
nano nikto_scan. 
Add the following content:

 
 
#!/bin/ 
TARGET=$1
nikto -h $TARGET -o nikto_scan_results.txt
Make it executable:

 
 
chmod +x nikto_scan. 
4.3. OpenVAS Script
Create a script openvas_scan.sh:

 
 
nano openvas_scan. 
Add the following content:

 
 
#!/bin/ 
TARGET=$1
gvm-cli socket --socketpath /var/run/gvmd.sock --xml "<create_target><name>Test Target</name><hosts>$TARGET</hosts></create_target>"
TASK_ID=$(gvm-cli socket --socketpath /var/run/gvmd.sock --xml "<create_task><name>Test Task</name><comment>Automated scan</comment><config id='daba56c8-73ec-11df-a475-002264764cea'/><target id='$TARGET_ID'/></create_task>" | grep -oP '(?<=<id>).*?(?=</id>)')
gvm-cli socket --socketpath /var/run/gvmd.sock --xml "<start_task task_id='$TASK_ID'/>"
Make it executable:

 
 
chmod +x openvas_scan. 
Step 5: Run Automated Security Testing
To run the scans, use the following commands:

5.1. Run Nmap
 
 
./nmap_scan.  <TARGET_IP>
5.2. Run Nikto
 
 
./nikto_scan.  <TARGET_URL>
5.3. Run OpenVAS
 
 
./openvas_scan.  <TARGET_IP>
Step 6: View Results
Each tool will generate output files (nmap_scan_results.txt, nikto_scan_results.txt, etc.) in the current directory, which you can review for vulnerabilities and issues.

Step 7: Scheduling with Cron (Optional)
To automate the scans regularly, you can use cron jobs. Open the cron table:

 
 
crontab -e
Add a cron job for the script (e.g., every day at 2 AM):

 
 
0 2 * * * /path/to/nmap_scan.sh <TARGET_IP>
Repeat for other scripts as needed.
