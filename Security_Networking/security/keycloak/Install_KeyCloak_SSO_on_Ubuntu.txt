How to Install KeyCloak SSO on Ubuntu 20.04. In this article, we will cover the basics of downloading and setting up a Keycloak server. Single sign on (SSO) is a controlling access of  multiple but independent, software systems. SSO is single authentication service to allow users to login to other services, without providing a password to the service that is being logged into.
What is KeyCloak?
Keycloak is a free and open source Identity and Access Management solution by RedHat Community. Its aim is to secure modern applications and services without writing any code. It provides a wide range of features including multifactor authentication, SSO, centralized user management, authentication, authorization, social login, and more. Keycloak allows you to add authentication to applications and secure services with minimum fuss. You don’t need to deal with storing users or authenticating users.
Keycloak provides single sign out, which means users only have to logout once to be logged out of all applications that use Keycloak. Keycloak is an Identity broker as it  authenticate users with existing OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 Identity Providers. Other important feature is that Keycloak has built in support to connect to existing LDAP or Active Directory servers.

Getting Started with KeyCloak Server
Before starting, it is always recommended to update the system packages to the updated version. Run the following command to update all the packages to the latest version:
apt-get update -y

java --version
You should see the Java version in the following output:

mkdir /etc/keycloak
Next, copy the sample configuration files from the /opt/keycloak directory using the following command:
cp /opt/keycloak/docs/contrib/scripts/systemd/wildfly.conf /etc/keycloak/keycloak.conf
cp /opt/keycloak/docs/contrib/scripts/systemd/launch.  /opt/keycloak/bin/
Next, set proper ownership using the following command:
chown keycloak: /opt/keycloak/bin/launch.
Next, edit the launch.sh file and define your Keycloak path:
nano /opt/keycloak/bin/launch.
Change the file as shown below:
#!/bin/
if [ "x$WILDFLY_HOME" = "x" ]; then
WILDFLY_HOME="/opt/keycloak"
fi
if [[ "$1" == "domain" ]]; then
$WILDFLY_HOME/bin/domain.sh -c $2 -b $3
else
$WILDFLY_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c $2 -b $3
fi
Save and close the file when you are finished.
Create a Systemd Service File for Keycloak
Next, you will need to create a systemd service file to manage the Keycloak service. You can copy the sample systemd service with the following command:
cp /opt/keycloak/docs/contrib/scripts/systemd/wildfly.service /etc/systemd/system/keycloak.service
Next, edit the keycloak.service file and define the Keycloak installation path:
nano /etc/systemd/system/keycloak.service
Change the file as shown below:
[Unit]
Description=The Keycloak Server
After=syslog.target network.target
Before=httpd.service
[Service]
Environment=LAUNCH_JBOSS_IN_BACKGROUND=1
EnvironmentFile=/etc/keycloak/keycloak.conf
User=keycloak
Group=keycloak
LimitNOFILE=102642
PIDFile=/var/run/keycloak/keycloak.pid
ExecStart=/opt/keycloak/bin/launch.sh $WILDFLY_MODE $WILDFLY_CONFIG $WILDFLY_BIND
Standard =null
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Save and close the file then reload the systemd daemon to apply the changes:
systemctl daemon-reload
Next, start the Keycloak service and enable it to start at system reboot:
systemctl start keycloak
systemctl enable keycloak
You can check the status of the Keycloak service with the following command:
systemctl status keycloak
You will get the following output:
