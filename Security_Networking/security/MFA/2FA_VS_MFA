2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) and MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) are both methods used to enhance security by requiring more than just a password for user authentication. Here's how they differ:

1. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**:
   - **Definition**: 2FA requires two different factors for authentication. Typically, these factors fall into three categories: something you know (like a password), something you have (like a smartphone or hardware token), or something you are (biometric data).
   - **Example**: Logging into an account with a password (something you know) and then receiving a code on your smartphone (something you have) that you need to enter to complete the login.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - **Definition**: MFA goes beyond 2FA by requiring more than two factors for authentication. It adds an additional layer of security by requiring at least two or more factors from different categories.
   - **Example**: Logging into an account with a password (something you know), receiving a code on your smartphone (something you have), and scanning a fingerprint (something you are) to complete the login.

**Key Differences**:
- **Number of Factors**: 2FA requires two factors, while MFA involves two or more factors.
- **Security Depth**: MFA provides a higher level of security compared to 2FA because it requires multiple factors, making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access.

In summary, while both 2FA and MFA aim to enhance security by requiring additional authentication beyond passwords, MFA provides an extra layer of protection by requiring multiple factors for authentication.
