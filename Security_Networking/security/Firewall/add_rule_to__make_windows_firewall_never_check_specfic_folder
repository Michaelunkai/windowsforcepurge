Here's a PowerShell script to create a rule that allows all traffic to and from the C:\study\Hacking\payloads folder by making sure Windows Firewall does not check this folder:


# Define the path to the folder
$folderPath = "C:\study\Hacking\payloads"

# Create a new firewall rule to allow all traffic to and from the folder
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow All Traffic to Payloads Folder" `
    -Direction Inbound `
    -Action Allow `
    -Path $folderPath `
    -Profile Any `
    -Enabled True

New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow All Traffic from Payloads Folder" `
    -Direction Outbound `
    -Action Allow `
    -Path $folderPath `
    -Profile Any `
    -Enabled True




one liner :

New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow All Traffic to Payloads Folder" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Profile Any -Enabled True; New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow All Traffic from Payloads Folder" -Direction Outbound -Action Allow -Profile Any -Enabled True



To confirm if the rules are functioning as expected, you can check them with:


Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow All Traffic to Payloads Folder"
Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow All Traffic from Payloads Folder"
