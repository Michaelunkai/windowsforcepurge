Here's how to add an "Allow SSH" rule in the pfSense firewall:

Step 1: Accessing the Firewall Rules Interface

Log in to the pfSense web interface.
Navigate to Firewall > Rules.
Step 2: Adding the Allow SSH Rule

In the Rules tab, select the interface where you want to add the rule (usually WAN for inbound traffic).
Click on the "+" button to add a new rule.
In the Description field, enter a descriptive name for the rule, such as "Allow SSH."
Set the Action to "Pass" to allow traffic that matches this rule.
Set the Interface(s) to "WAN" or the appropriate interface where the SSH traffic will be coming from.
In the Address Family dropdown, select "IPv4" or "IPv6" depending on your network configuration.
In the Protocol dropdown, select "TCP."
In the Destination Port Range, enter "SSH" or port "22."
Optionally, you can specify the source IP address or range under the Source section to restrict SSH access to specific IPs.
Leave the rest of the fields at their default settings or adjust them as needed.
Click on the "Save" button to save the rule.
Step 3: Applying the Changes

After saving the rule, click on the "Apply Changes" button to apply the configuration changes to the firewall.
Wait for the changes to be applied, and the rule will take effect immediately.
Verification: Testing SSH Access
To verify that the SSH rule is working:

Attempt to SSH into your pfSense firewall from a remote location using the configured WAN IP address.
If the connection is successful, the SSH rule is working correctly.
That's it! You've successfully added an "Allow SSH" rule to the pfSense firewall, allowing SSH traffic to pass through the WAN interface. Adjust the rule as needed based on your network security requirements.
