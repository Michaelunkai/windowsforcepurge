Here are the steps with the commands included:

Encrypting a File:
Install GPG: If you haven't already, install GPG on your system.

Generate a Key Pair (Optional):

 
 
gpg --full-generate-key
Encrypt the File: For asymmetric encryption:

 
 
gpg --encrypt --recipient <recipient's key> <filename>
For symmetric encryption:

 
 
gpg --symmetric <filename>
Enter Passphrase (if using symmetric encryption): If using symmetric encryption, you'll be prompted to enter a passphrase.

Decrypting a File:
Decrypt the File:

 
 
gpg --decrypt <encrypted_filename.gpg>
Enter Passphrase (if using symmetric encryption): If the file was encrypted symmetrically, enter the passphrase you set during encryption.

Tips:
Specify   File:
 
 
gpg --decrypt <encrypted_filename.gpg> -o <output_filename>
Key Management:
 
 
gpg --list-keys
 
 
gpg --list-secret-keys
