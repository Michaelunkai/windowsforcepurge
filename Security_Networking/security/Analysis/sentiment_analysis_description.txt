Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a process that uses natural language processing (NLP), text analysis, and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information from text. The goal of sentiment analysis is to determine the attitude or emotional tone expressed in a body of text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral. This technique is widely used in various applications, such as:
1. Customer Feedback: Analyzing customer reviews, comments, and social media posts to gauge public opinion about products, services, or brands.
2. Market Research: Understanding market trends and consumer sentiment toward different topics or industries.
3. Political Analysis: Examining public opinion on political issues, candidates, or events.
4. Social Media Monitoring: Tracking sentiment in social media discussions to identify emerging issues or trends.
Sentiment analysis typically involves several steps, including text preprocessing, feature extraction, and applying machine learning algorithms or lexicon-based approaches to classify the sentiment.
