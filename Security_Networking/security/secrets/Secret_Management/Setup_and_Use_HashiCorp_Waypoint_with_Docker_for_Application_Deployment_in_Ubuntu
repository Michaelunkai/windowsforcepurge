Setup_and_Use_Ha iCorp_Waypoint_with_Docker_for_Application_Deployment_in_Ubuntu
Step 1: Install Waypoint
Download and install the Waypoint binary from the official HashiCorp releases page.

Download the latest Waypoint binary for Linux:

 
 
curl -o waypoint.zip https://releases.hashicorp.com/waypoint/0.10.1/waypoint_0.10.1_linux_amd64.zip
Unzip the binary:

 
 
sudo apt install unzip
unzip waypoint.zip
Move the binary to /usr/local/bin:

 
 
sudo mv waypoint /usr/local/bin/
Verify the installation:

 
 
waypoint version
Step 2: Initialize a Waypoint Project
Create a new directory for your application:

 
 
mkdir my-app
cd my-app
Create a simple Flask application (app.py):

 
 
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
Create a requirements.txt file with Flask listed as a dependency:

 
 
Flask==2.0.1
Create a Dockerfile:

Dockerfile
 
FROM  :3.8-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .

RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi. .org -r requirements.txt

COPY . /app

EXPOSE 5000

CMD [" ", "app.py"]
Step 3: Initialize a Waypoint Project
Initialize a new Waypoint project:

 
 
waypoint init
Update the waypoint.hcl file with the following content:

hcl
 
project = "my-app"

app "example" {
  labels = {
    "service" = "web"
  }

  build {
    use "docker" {}
  }

  deploy {
    use "docker" {}
  }

  release {
    use "docker" {}
  }
}
Step 4: Build, Deploy, and Release with Waypoint
Authenticate Waypoint with Docker and accept Terms of Service:

 
 
waypoint install --platform=docker -accept-tos
Build, deploy, and release the application:

 
 
waypoint up
Step 5: Access the Application
List running Docker containers to find the one created by Waypoint:

 
 
docker ps
Get the containerâ€™s port to access the application:

 
 
docker port <container_id>
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:<port> to see your deployed application.
