Basic Usage with cURL
To solve a Cloudflare challenge and fetch a webpage using FlareSolverr, send a POST request with cURL. Replace https://example.com with the URL you want to access:

 
 
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8191/v1' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
        "cmd": "request.get",
        "url": "https://example.com"
      }'
This command sends a GET request to https://example.com and returns the page content, solving any Cloudflare challenges automatically.
