 Using with Scrapers
FlareSolverr can be used with scraping libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy. Hereâ€™s an example using BeautifulSoup:

 
 
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = 'http://localhost:8191/v1'
payload = {
    "cmd": "request.get",
    "url": "https://example.com"
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload)
result = response.json()

html_content = result.get('solution').get('response')
soup = BeautifulSoup(html_content, 'html.parser')

print(soup.prettify())
