## Comprehensive Guide to Setting Up and Using Envoy Proxy for Edge and Service Proxy on Ubuntu

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and configuring Envoy Proxy on Ubuntu. Envoy is an open-source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications.

### Step 1: Update Package List and Install Prerequisites

First, update the package list and install the required packages.

  
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https gnupg2 curl lsb-release

### Step 2: Add the GetEnvoy GPG Key

Next, add the GetEnvoy GPG key.

  
curl -sL 'https://deb.dl.getenvoy.io/public/gpg.8115BA8E629CC074.key' | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/getenvoy-keyring.gpg

### Step 3: Verify the GPG Key

Verify the key by checking its SHA256 hash.

  
echo a077cb587a1b622e03aa4bf2f3689de14658a9497a9af2c427bba5f4cc3c4723 /usr/share/keyrings/getenvoy-keyring.gpg | sha256sum --check

You should see output indicating that the key is OK.

### Step 4: Add the GetEnvoy Repository

Add the GetEnvoy repository to your system's package sources.

  
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/getenvoy-keyring.gpg] https://deb.dl.getenvoy.io/public/deb/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/getenvoy.list

### Step 5: Update Package List Again

Update the package list again to include the new repository.

  
sudo apt update

### Step 6: Install Envoy

Finally, install Envoy using the following command:

  
sudo apt install -y getenvoy-envoy

### Step 7: Verify the Installation

Verify that Envoy has been installed correctly by checking its version.

  
envoy --version

You should see the version of Envoy that has been installed.

### Step 8: Basic Configuration of Envoy

Create a basic configuration file for Envoy. Create a file named `envoy.yaml` with the following content:

  
static_resources:
  listeners:
  - name: listener_0
    address:
      socket_address:
        address: 0.0.0.0
        port_value: 10000
    filter_chains:
    - filters:
      - name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager
        typed_config:
          "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager
          stat_prefix: ingress_http
          route_config:
            name: local_route
            virtual_hosts:
            - name: local_service
              domains:
              - "*"
              routes:
              - match:
                  prefix: "/"
                route:
                  cluster: some_service
          http_filters:
          - name: envoy.filters.http.router
  clusters:
  - name: some_service
    connect_timeout: 0.25s
    type: LOGICAL_DNS
    lb_policy: ROUND_ROBIN
    load_assignment:
      cluster_name: some_service
      endpoints:
      - lb_endpoints:
        - endpoint:
            address:
              socket_address:
                address: some_service_address
                port_value: 80

Replace `some_service_address` with the actual address of the service you want to proxy.

### Step 9: Run Envoy

Run Envoy with the created configuration file.

  
envoy -c envoy. 

### Step 10: Verify Envoy is Running

You can verify that Envoy is running by checking the logs or by sending a request to it using `curl` or a browser.

  
curl http://localhost:10000

This should forward the request to the service defined in your configuration file.

By following these steps, you should have Envoy Proxy set up and running on your Ubuntu system. If you have any specific use cases or further configurations you want to implement, feel free to ask!
