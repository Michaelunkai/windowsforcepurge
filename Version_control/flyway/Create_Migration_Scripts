Create Migration Scripts
Create a directory for your migration scripts within the Flyway directory:

 
 
mkdir /opt/flyway/ 
Create your first migration script in the /opt/flyway/sql directory. Flyway uses a specific naming convention for migration files: V<version_number>__<description>.sql.

Example:

 
 
nano /opt/flyway/ /V1__Create_person_table. 
Add your SQL statements to this file:

 
 
CREATE TABLE person (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

 Apply Migrations
Run Flyway to apply the migrations:

 
 
flyway migrate
Flyway will connect to the database using the details in flyway.conf and apply any pending migrations.
