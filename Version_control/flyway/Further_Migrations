Further Migrations
For any subsequent migrations, create new migration scripts in the /opt/flyway/sql directory following the same naming convention.

Example:

 
 
nano /opt/flyway/ /V2__Add_email_to_person. 
Add your SQL statements:

 
 
ALTER TABLE person ADD email VARCHAR(100);
Apply the new migration:

 
 
flyway migrate
