### Comprehensive Guide to Setup, Run, and Use Pachyderm with Docker, Kubernetes, Minikube, Helm, and Pachyderm CLI on Ubuntu

This tutorial will provide a detailed step-by-step guide on how to set up, run, and use Pachyderm, a data versioning and pipeline tool, on Ubuntu using Docker, Kubernetes (with Minikube), Helm, and Pachyderm CLI. The tutorial includes all necessary installation commands and configurations.

---

### Step 1: Install Docker (Pachyderm Requires Docker)
Docker is required to run Pachyderm on your machine. Follow these steps to install Docker:

  
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

After installing Docker, you may need to log out and back in to apply the group changes.

---

### Step 2: Install `kubectl` (Kubernetes Command-Line Tool)
Pachyderm operates on a Kubernetes cluster, and `kubectl` is the command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes.

  
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubectl

---

### Step 3: Install a Local Kubernetes Cluster Using Minikube
Minikube is used to run a local Kubernetes cluster. You will install it and start the cluster using the following commands:

  
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y conntrack
curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
minikube start --driver=docker

---

### Step 4: Install Helm (Pachyderm Installation Requires Helm)
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Pachyderm uses Helm for deployment, so youâ€™ll need to install it using the following command:

  
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash

---

### Step 5: Add Pachyderm Helm Repository
To deploy Pachyderm, add the Pachyderm Helm chart repository and update it.

  
helm repo add pachyderm https://helm.pachyderm.com
helm repo update

---

### Step 6: Deploy Pachyderm Using Helm
Now, you will use Helm to install Pachyderm on your Kubernetes cluster.

  
helm install pachd pachyderm/pachyderm --namespace default --set deployTarget=LOCAL

This command deploys Pachyderm on the default namespace using Minikube as the Kubernetes platform.

---

### Step 7: Verify Pachyderm Deployment
After deployment, verify that the Pachyderm pods are running by listing all the pods in the namespace:

  
kubectl get pods

You should see Pachyderm-related pods (e.g., `pachd`) running in the output.

---

### Step 8: Install Pachyderm CLI (`pachctl`)
The Pachyderm CLI (`pachctl`) allows you to interact with the Pachyderm deployment. Install it using the following commands:

  
sudo apt-get install -y curl
curl -o /tmp/pachctl.deb -L https://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm/releases/download/v2.0.0/pachctl_2.0.0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i /tmp/pachctl.deb

---

### Step 9: Configure Pachyderm CLI (`pachctl`)
To interact with your local Pachyderm deployment, configure `pachctl` to point to your Minikube cluster:

  
pachctl config set context `kubectl config current-context` --namespace default

---

### Step 10: Verify Pachyderm Setup
You can now use the `pachctl` command-line tool to verify that everything is set up correctly by listing the repositories:

  
pachctl list repo

You should see an empty list if this is a fresh installation.

---

### Step 11: Create a Pachyderm Pipeline
You can now create a sample pipeline. First, create a JSON file for the pipeline configuration.

  
nano pipeline.json

Paste the following content into the file:

 json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "name": "example-pipeline"
  },
  "input": {
    "pfs": {
      "glob": "/*",
      "repo": "example-repo"
    }
  },
  "transform": {
    "cmd": [ "bash" ],
    "stdin": [
      "echo 'Processing input data'",
      "cat /pfs/example-repo/* > /pfs/out/output.txt"
    ]
  }
}

This pipeline takes data from `example-repo`, processes it using the bash command, and stores the result in the output.

---

### Step 12: Create a Pachyderm Repository
To store data, create a repository called `example-repo`:

  
pachctl create repo example-repo

---

### Step 13: Create the Pipeline
Now, create the pipeline using the `pipeline.json` file created earlier:

  
pachctl create pipeline -f pipeline.json

---

### Step 14: Add Data to the Repository
Add some sample data to the repository for the pipeline to process:

  
echo "Sample data" | pachctl put file example-repo@master:/data.txt

---

### Step 15: View Pipeline Output
Once the pipeline processes the data, you can view the output by running the following commands:

  
pachctl list file example-pipeline@master:/output.txt
pachctl get file example-pipeline@master:/output.txt

You should see the processed data in the output.

---

This completes the full setup, run, and use of Pachyderm in Ubuntu using Docker, Kubernetes (Minikube), Helm, and Pachyderm CLI.x
