Create An Easy to Use Bash Script Repository Using GitHub
In this example I'll be setting up a GitHub repository to host bash files, using the GitHub URL Shortener to simplify the URLs and then running the scripts locally on a Debian based virtual machine

Create the GitHub Repository
Create or log into your existing GitHub account
Click the New button in the top left to create a new repository
Give the repository a name > Click the Create Repository button
Creating a Sample Bash Script
Open a text editor
Paste the following script into a new text document
#!/bin/ 
echo "hello, today is $(date '+%A'). You are running me as $(whoami)."

Save the file as whoami.sh
Back in the browser, click the uploading an existing file link
Upload the whoami.sh file and give a brief description > Click the Commit changes button
Click on the newly uploaded file
Click the Raw tab at the top right of the code
Copy the URL for the raw code
Open another browser tab and navigate to https://git.io
Paste in the raw code URL from the clipboard > Click Shorten
Copy the shortened URL
Executing the Sample Bash Script
Launch terminal and execute the bash file from GitHub by running the following command
curl -L PastedShortenedURL | bash
