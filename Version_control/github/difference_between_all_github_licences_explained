When creating a repository on GitHub, you have the option to add a license to your project. The choice of license determines how others can use, modify, and distribute your code. Here are the most common licenses and their key characteristics:

### 1. MIT License
- **Permissions**: Permits users to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the software.
- **Conditions**: Requires inclusion of the original copyright notice and the license text in all copies or substantial portions of the software.
- **Limitations**: No warranty is provided; liability is disclaimed.

### 2. Apache License 2.0
- **Permissions**: Allows users to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and sublicense the code.
- **Conditions**: Requires a prominent notice of changes made to the original work, inclusion of the license in any redistributed code, and a grant of patent rights to users.
- **Limitations**: Provides an express grant of patent rights from contributors to users; no warranty or liability.

### 3. GNU General Public License (GPL)
- **Permissions**: Users can use, modify, and distribute the software.
- **Conditions**: Requires that derivative works also be distributed under the GPL license (copyleft). Must include the source code or provide access to it.
- **Limitations**: No warranty; strong copyleft license.

### 4. GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
- **Permissions**: Similar to GPL, but allows linking to non-(L)GPL-licensed software.
- **Conditions**: Modifications to the LGPL-licensed parts must be released under LGPL, but proprietary software can link to LGPL libraries.
- **Limitations**: Lesser copyleft compared to GPL; no warranty.

### 5. Mozilla Public License 2.0 (MPL)
- **Permissions**: Users can use, modify, and distribute the software.
- **Conditions**: Source code must be made available for any modifications distributed in executable form. Allows combination with proprietary code.
- **Limitations**: No warranty; file-level copyleft (only modified files must be open-sourced).

### 6. BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" or "FreeBSD" License
- **Permissions**: Users can use, copy, modify, and distribute the software.
- **Conditions**: Must retain the copyright notice and a disclaimer of liability.
- **Limitations**: No warranty; more permissive with minimal restrictions.

### 7. BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License
- **Permissions**: Similar to the 2-Clause BSD License with additional clauses.
- **Conditions**: Adds a clause preventing the use of the names of the project and its contributors for promotional purposes without written permission.
- **Limitations**: No warranty; permissive.

### 8. Creative Commons Zero (CC0)
- **Permissions**: Effectively places the work in the public domain, allowing users to do anything they wish with it.
- **Conditions**: None.
- **Limitations**: No warranty.

### 9. Unlicense
- **Permissions**: Dedicated to the public domain; similar to CC0.
- **Conditions**: None.
- **Limitations**: No warranty.

### 10. Proprietary License
- **Permissions**: Defined by the licensor, typically restricting use, modification, and distribution.
- **Conditions**: Specific to the proprietary terms set by the author.
- **Limitations**: Varies widely; may include warranties and liabilities.

### Choosing a License
When choosing a license, consider the following:
- **Permissiveness**: Do you want to allow unrestricted use of your code? (e.g., MIT, BSD)
- **Copyleft**: Do you want to require derivative works to also be open-source? (e.g., GPL, LGPL)
- **Patent Rights**: Do you want to provide an express grant of patent rights? (e.g., Apache 2.0)
- **Combination with Proprietary Code**: Do you want to allow your code to be used in proprietary software? (e.g., MPL, LGPL)
