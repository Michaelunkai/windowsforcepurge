How to Remove a Problematic File from a Git Repository
If you encounter issues with a file that has special characters or a long name in your Git repository, follow these steps to remove it:

Step 1: Open Terminal and Navigate to Your Repository
Open your terminal (or PowerShell on Windows) and navigate to your repository directory.

 
 
cd path/to/your/repository
Step 2: Remove the Problematic File from Git Cache
Use the git rm command with the appropriate escaping to remove the problematic file from the Git index (staging area). Replace <path/to/problematic/file> with the actual file path.

 
 
git rm --cached "<path/to/problematic/file>"
If the file path contains special characters like newlines, you might need to use a wildcard * to match the filename:

 
 
git rm --cached "<path/to/problematic/file*>"
Step 3: Commit the Changes
Commit the changes to your local repository. Replace "Removed problematic file" with your own commit message if needed.

 
 
git commit -m "Removed problematic file"
Step 4: Push the Changes to the Remote Repository
Push the changes to your remote repository to update it.

 
 
git push origin main
Example
If your problematic file path is:

 
 
" /fix error The requested operation could not be completed due to a virtual disk system\nlimitation. Virtual hard disk files must be uncompressed and unencrypted and must not be sparse. (0xC03A001A)"
You would run:

 
 
git rm --cached " /fix error The requested operation could not be completed due to a virtual disk system\nlimitation. Virtual hard disk files must be uncompressed and unencrypted and must not be sparse. (0xC03A001A)"
git commit -m "Removed problematic file"
git push origin main
Or using a wildcard:

 
 
git rm --cached " /fix error The requested operation could not be completed due to a virtual disk system*"
git commit -m "Removed problematic file"
git push origin main
