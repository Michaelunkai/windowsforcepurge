#Make sure you are on the branch where you made the updates:

git checkout your_branch_name

#Replace your_branch_name with the actual name of the branch where you made the updates.

#Commit your changes:


git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"

#Create the new tag (v1.1):


git tag v1.1

#This creates a new tag at the latest commit.

#Push the new tag to the remote repository:

    git push origin v1.1

#This pushes the new tag to your GitHub repository.

#Now, your repository has a new tag (v1.1) that includes the latest changes. If you want to switch back to this specific version of your code, you can use the tag:

git checkout v1.1

#Remember to replace your_branch_name with your actual branch name and adjust the commit message as needed.
