This message means that there are deleted files in your working directory that Git has detected but you haven't staged them for commit yet. To resolve this, you need to stage the deletions and then commit and push the changes to your remote repository.

Fixing the Issue
Follow these steps to fix the issue:

Stage the deletions:

Use the git add -u command to stage all changes, including deletions. The -u option stands for "update," which stages modifications and deletions but not new files.

Commit the changes:

Commit the staged changes with a message describing what you did. In this case, you are removing deleted files.

Pu  the changes:

Push the committed changes to your remote repository.

One-Liner Command
To perform all the steps in one go, you can use the following one-liner command:


git add -u && git commit -m "Remove deleted files" && git push origin main





Here's a breakdown of the command:

git add -u: Stages all modifications and deletions.
git commit -m "Remove deleted files": Commits the staged changes with a message.
git push origin main: Pushes the committed changes to the main branch on the remote repository.
Example
Let's see an example of how this works. Suppose you have the following output from git status:




On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")




To stage the deletions, commit them, and push the changes to the remote repository, run:



git add -u && git commit -m "Remove deleted files" && git push origin main




After running this command, your changes will be staged, committed, and pushed to the main branch, resolving the issue.

Conclusion
By using the git add -u command,
