### Comprehensive Guide: Running and Using the GitHub Actions Labeler App from the Repository on Ubuntu

To run and use the app from the `actions/labeler` GitHub repository on Ubuntu, follow these detailed steps:

### Prerequisites
1. **Git**: Ensure Git is installed on your system.
2. **Node.js**: Ensure Node.js is installed, as GitHub Actions often require it.

### Steps

#### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:
  
git clone https://github.com/actions/labeler.git
cd labeler

#### 2. Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies using npm:
  
npm install

#### 3. Configure the Workflow
To use the `labeler` action in your repository, you need to create a workflow configuration file in your GitHub repository.

Create a directory for GitHub Actions workflows if it doesn't exist:
  
mkdir -p .github/workflows

Create a new workflow file, e.g., `labeler.yml`:
  
nano .github/workflows/labeler.yml

Add the following configuration to the file:
  
name: "Pull Request Labeler"
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

jobs:
  label:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Pull Request Labeler
      uses: actions/labeler@v3
      with:
        repo-token: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
        configuration-path: .github/labeler.yml

#### 4. Configure Labeler Rules
Create a configuration file for the labeler action:
  
nano .github/labeler.yml

Add your labeling rules. For example:
  
# Example label configuration
bug:
  - 'src/**/*.js'
  - 'tests/**/*.js'

documentation:
  - 'docs/**/*.md'
  - 'README.md'

#### 5. Commit and Push Changes
Commit and push the changes to your GitHub repository:
  
git add .github/
git commit -m "Add labeler workflow"
git push origin main

#### 6. Verify the Action
After pushing the changes, GitHub will automatically run the workflow whenever a pull request is opened, synchronized, or reopened. You can check the action's execution under the "Actions" tab of your repository on GitHub.

### Running the App Locally
While the labeler action is designed to run on GitHub, you can test it locally using `act`, a tool for running GitHub Actions locally.

1. Install `act`:
     
   brew install act
   or
     
   sudo apt-get install act

2. Run the workflow locally:
     
   act pull_request

This will simulate the GitHub Actions environment and run the `labeler` action locally.

### Additional Information
- For more detailed configuration options, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/actions/labeler#readme).
