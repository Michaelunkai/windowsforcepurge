Join Worker Nodes (Optional)
If you want to add worker nodes to your cluster, follow this process. On the worker node:

First, generate a token from the control plane (run on your control node):

 
 
sudo k0s token create --role=worker
Install K0s on the worker node as done in Step 1, and then run the following command to join the worker node to the cluster:

 
 
sudo k0s worker <token>
Install the worker node as a service:

 
 
sudo k0s install worker --token-file <token_file>
Start the worker service:

 
 
sudo systemctl start k0sworker
Enable the worker service to start at boot:

 
 
sudo systemctl enable k0sworker
