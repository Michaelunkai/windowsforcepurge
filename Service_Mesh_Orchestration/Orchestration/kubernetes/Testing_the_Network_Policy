Testing the Network Policy
Test with a non-allowed pod:

From the busybox pod (which doesnâ€™t have the access: granted label), try to access the nginx pod:

 
 
kubectl exec -n netpol-demo busybox -- wget --timeout=5 nginx
The connection should time out, showing that the network policy is blocking traffic.

Label the busybox pod and test again:

Now, label the busybox pod with access: granted and test the connection again:

 
 
kubectl label pod busybox access=granted -n netpol-demo
kubectl exec -n netpol-demo busybox -- wget --timeout=5 nginx
This time, the connection should be successful, as the policy allows pods with the access: granted label to reach the nginx pod.
