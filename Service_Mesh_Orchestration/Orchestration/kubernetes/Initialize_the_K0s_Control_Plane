Initialize the K0s Control Plane
Create a single-node Kubernetes cluster by initializing the control plane:

 
 
sudo k0s controller --single
If you want to run K0s as a system service (recommended for production), you can install the K0s service with:

 
 
sudo k0s install controller --single
Start the K0s controller service:

 
 
sudo systemctl start k0scontroller
Enable the service to start at boot:

 
 
sudo systemctl enable k0scontroller
