 Integrating Falco with Alerting Systems
Integrating Falco with alerting systems like Slack allows you to receive real-time security alerts.

7.1. Install Falco Sidekick
Falco Sidekick is an add-on that enables Falco to send alerts to various outputs, including Slack.

7.1.1. Enable Falco Sidekick During Falco Installation
If you prefer to include Sidekick during the initial Falco installation, you can uninstall and reinstall Falco with Sidekick enabled.

Uninstall Existing Falco Installation:

 
 
helm uninstall falco -n falco
Reinstall Falco with Sidekick Enabled:

 
 
helm install falco falcosecurity/falco --namespace falco --set falcosidekick.enabled=true
7.1.2. Alternatively, Install Falco Sidekick Separately
If you prefer to install Falco Sidekick separately:

 
 
helm install falco-sidekick falcosecurity/falco-sidekick --namespace falco
7.2. Configure Slack Integration
Create a Slack App and Get a Webhook URL:

Navigate to your Slack workspace.
Go to Apps > Manage Apps > Custom Integrations > Incoming Webhooks.
Create a new webhook and copy the webhook URL.
Create a ConfigMap for Falco Sidekick Configuration:

Create a file named falco-sidekick-config.yaml with the following content:

 
 
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: falco-sidekick-config
  namespace: falco
data:
  config. : |
    slack:
      enabled: true
      webhook_url: "https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url"
      channel: "#your-channel"
      username: "Falco"
      icon_emoji: ":falco:"
Replace:

"https://hooks.slack.com/services/your/webhook/url" with your actual Slack webhook URL.
"#your-channel" with your desired Slack channel.
Apply the Configuration:

 
 
kubectl apply -f falco-sidekick-config.yaml
Restart Falco Sidekick Pods:

 
 
kubectl rollout restart deployment falco-sidekick -n falco
Note: Ensure that the falco-sidekick deployment is correctly referencing the falco-sidekick-config ConfigMap. If not, you may need to update the deployment or Helm values accordingly.
