Installing Falco
Falco can be installed using Helm, which simplifies deployment and management.

4.1. Add the Falco Helm Repository
 
 
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts
helm repo update
Expected  :

 
 
"falcosecurity" has been added to your repositories
Hang tight while we grab the latest from your chart repositories...
...Successfully got an update from the "falcosecurity" chart repository
Update Complete. ⎈Happy Helming!⎈
4.2. Create a Namespace for Falco
 
 
kubectl create namespace falco
Expected  :

arduino
 
namespace/falco created
4.3. Install Falco with Default Configuration
 
 
helm install falco falcosecurity/falco --namespace falco
Expected  :

 
 
NAME: falco
LAST DEPLOYED: [Date and Time]
NAMESPACE: falco
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
TEST SUITE: None
Note: By default, Falco should deploy with its standard configuration, including the necessary ConfigMaps.

Verifying Falco Installation
After installation, verify that Falco is running correctly and that all necessary components are in place.

5.1. Check Falco Pods
 
 
kubectl get pods -n falco
Expected  :

 
 
NAME                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
falco-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy         1/1     Running   0          2m
Note: The pod name may vary based on the Helm chart version and release.

5.2. Verify ConfigMaps
The falco-config ConfigMap should exist in the falco namespace. However, based on your previous attempt, it was missing. Let's confirm and address this.

 
 
kubectl get configmaps -n falco
Expected  :

arduino
 
NAME                DATA   AGE
falco-config        1      2m
falco-rules         1      2m
Note: If falco-config is still missing, proceed to the troubleshooting steps below.
