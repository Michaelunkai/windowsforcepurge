Prerequisites
At least two Ubuntu machines (one manager node and one or more worker nodes)
NFS server installed and configured
Step 1: Install Docker on All Nodes
First, install Docker on all the nodes (manager and worker nodes).

Update the package index:

 
 
sudo apt-get update
Install Docker:

 
 
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io
Start Docker and enable it to start at boot:

 
 
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
Step 2: Set Up Docker Swarm
Initialize Docker Swarm on the manager node:

 
 
sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.1.100
Replace 192.168.1.100 with the IP address of your manager node. This command will output a docker swarm join command which will be used to join worker nodes to the swarm.

Join worker nodes to the swarm:
On each worker node, run the docker swarm join command you received from the manager node:

 
 
sudo docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-4hweu76lb5z8eubks0em1a8nrwq1al9gd8j5cknr2v62u9nz6s-6fi3qpiwp0sf4kjfhj3o5s32s 192.168.1.100:2377
Step 3: Set Up NFS Server for Persistent Storage
Install NFS server on a node that will act as the NFS server:

 
 
sudo apt-get install -y nfs-kernel-server
Create a directory to be  ared:

 
 
sudo mkdir -p /srv/nfs/ are
sudo chown nobody:nogroup /srv/nfs/ are
sudo chmod 777 /srv/nfs/ are
Edit the NFS exports file to add the directory to be  ared:

 
 
sudo nano /etc/exports
Add the following line:

 
 
/srv/nfs/ are  *(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
Export the  ared directory:

 
 
sudo exportfs -a
Restart the NFS server:

 
 
sudo systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server
Step 4: Configure NFS Client on All Swarm Nodes
Install NFS client:

 
 
sudo apt-get install -y nfs-common
Create a directory to mount the NFS  are:

 
 
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/nfs/ are
Mount the NFS  are:

 
 
sudo mount 192.168.1.200:/srv/nfs/ are /mnt/nfs/ are
To mount the NFS  are automatically at boot, add the following line to /etc/fstab:

 
 
192.168.1.200:/srv/nfs/ are /mnt/nfs/ are nfs defaults 0 0
Step 5: Deploy a Service with Persistent Storage
Create a Docker service that uses the NFS volume:

First, create a docker-compose.yml file:

 
 
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    volumes:
      - type: volume
        source: nfs-data
        target: /usr/ are/nginx/html

volumes:
  nfs-data:
    driver_opts:
      type: "nfs"
      o: "addr=192.168.1.200,rw"
      device: ":/srv/nfs/ are"
Deploy the stack using Docker Swarm:

 
 
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml my_stack
Step 6: Verify the Setup
Check the status of the services:

 
 
docker service ls
Verify that the NFS  are is mounted and being used by the containers:

 
 
docker inspect <container_id>
Replace <container_id> with the ID of a running container to verify the volume is correctly mounted.

Conclusion
You now have a Docker Swarm cluster set up with persistent storage using NFS. The NFS server provides a  ared directory that all nodes in the Swarm can access, ensuring that data persists even if containers are moved between nodes.
