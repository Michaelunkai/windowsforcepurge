Setting up HashiCorp Nomad for workload orchestration on Ubuntu involves several steps, including installing dependencies, downloading and installing Nomad, configuring it, and then running some basic commands to ensure everything is set up correctly. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

### Step 1: Update System

First, make sure your system is up to date.

  
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Nomad requires `curl` and `unzip` for downloading and extracting the binaries.

  
sudo apt-get install -y curl unzip

### Step 3: Download and Install Nomad

Visit the [Nomad releases page](https://www.nomadproject.io/downloads) to get the latest version link, or use the following commands to download and install Nomad:

  
# Download Nomad
curl -LO https://releases.ha icorp.com/nomad/1.5.6/nomad_1.5.6_linux_amd64.zip

# Unzip the downloaded file
unzip nomad_1.5.6_linux_amd64.zip

# Move the binary to a directory in your PATH
sudo mv nomad /usr/local/bin/

# Verify installation
nomad --version

### Step 4: Configure Nomad

Create a configuration directory for Nomad:

  
sudo mkdir -p /etc/nomad.d
sudo chmod 700 /etc/nomad.d

Create a basic configuration file for Nomad:

  
sudo nano /etc/nomad.d/nomad.hcl

Add the following configuration to the file:

 hcl
log_level = "INFO"
data_dir  = "/opt/nomad"

server {
  enabled          = true
  bootstrap_expect = 1
}

client {
  enabled = true
}

This configuration sets up a single-node Nomad cluster with both server and client roles enabled.

### Step 5: Create Nomad Service

Create a systemd service file to manage Nomad as a service:

  
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/nomad.service

Add the following content:

 ini
[Unit]
Description=Nomad
Documentation=https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/nomad agent -config=/etc/nomad.d
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
KillMode=process
Restart=on-failure
LimitNOFILE=65536

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

### Step 6: Start and Enable Nomad Service

Enable and start the Nomad service:

  
sudo systemctl enable nomad
sudo systemctl start nomad

Verify the service status:

  
sudo systemctl status nomad

### Step 7: Verify Nomad Installation

To verify that Nomad is installed and running correctly, you can use the following command:

  
nomad node status

You should see the status of the node you just set up.

### Step 8: Run a Sample Job

Create a sample Nomad job file to test your setup:

  
nano example.nomad

Add the following content to the file:

 hcl
job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]

  group "example" {
    task "server" {
      driver = "docker"

      config {
        image = "nginx:latest"
        ports = ["http"]
      }

      resources {
        cpu    = 500
        memory = 256
      }
    }
  }

  network {
    port "http" {
      static = 8080
    }
  }
}

Run the job:

  
nomad run example.nomad

Check the job status:

  
nomad status example

You should see that the job is running successfully. You can also check if Nginx is running by visiting `http://<your-server-ip>:8080`.

### Conclusion

You have now set up HashiCorp Nomad on Ubuntu and run a basic job to verify the installation. You can explore more advanced configurations and features in the [Nomad documentation](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs).
