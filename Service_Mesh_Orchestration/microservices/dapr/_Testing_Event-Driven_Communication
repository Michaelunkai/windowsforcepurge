 Testing Event-Driven Communication
Once both services are running, test the communication by sending a message to Service A (Publisher).

Step 1: Use curl to Publish a Message
Run the following curl command to send a message to Service A:

 
 
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/publish \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"message": "Hello, Dapr!"}'
Step 2: Verify Message in Service B (Subscriber)
In the terminal running Service B, you should see the following output:

 
 
Received message: Hello, Dapr!
This confirms that the message was successfully published by Service A and received by Service B using Dapr's pub/sub.
