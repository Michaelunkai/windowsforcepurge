Can You Run VirtualBox Inside of a ProxMox VM?
A Little Background
First, let me give a little background since this seems like an unnecessary use case. I had the idea of converting a physical Windows PC into a ProxMox VM (P2V) to allow me to better separate the PC resources for different tasks. Currently one of the main uses for the PC is to quickly test different things using VirtualBox. This could be testing new Linux distro releases, working through steps for a new application install tutorial or walking through the steps of an existing tutorial when an issue is reported by a viewer. I have a workflow that I like to use and I didn't want to abandon VirtualBox and migrate the workflow to ProxMox. So, is it possible and if so, how well does it work?

Log into the Proxmox Web UI
Expand the node and select the target VM
Select Hardware from the sub-navigation menu
Double click the Processors entry > Set the Type value to host
Note: this will passthrough all the functionality of the Proxmox host processor to the VM
Start the Proxmox VM
Log into the VM
Download VirtualBox and the Virtualbox Extension Pack Download
Install VirtualBox
Install the VirtualBox Extension Pack
Create or import a 64-bit VirtualBox VM
Start the new VirtualBox VM
Does is work?
