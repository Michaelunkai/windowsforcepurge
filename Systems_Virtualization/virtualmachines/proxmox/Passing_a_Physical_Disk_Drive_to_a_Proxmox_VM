Passing a Physical Disk Drive to a Proxmox VM
Log into ProxMox VE, either at the console or the web UI and launch the web shell
Take note of the VM ID that the physical hard disk will be connecting to
Run the following commands
# list hard disk devices and ids
lsblk |awk 'NR==1{print $0" DEVICE-ID(S)"}NR>1{dev=$1;printf $0" ";system("find /dev/disk/by-id -lname \"*"dev"\" -printf \" %p\"");print "";}'|grep -v -E 'part|lvm'
# copy the /dev/disk/by-id.... for the device to passthrough
# add the disk to the VM, update the VM ID as needed
# usage:
# qm set <%VM ID%> -<%VIRTUAL DEVICE%> <%DEV DISK ID%>
qm set 100 -scsi1 /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-360026b902ad1ae00293167790419d3f2
Stop the VM and Start it fresh for the new configuration change to take effect
Verify inside the guest OS that the physical disk is connected
