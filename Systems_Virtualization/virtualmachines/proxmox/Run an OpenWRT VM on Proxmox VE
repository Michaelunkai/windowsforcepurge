Run an OpenWRT VM on Proxmox VE
What is OpenWRT?
OpenWrt is an open-source project for embedded operating systems based on Linux, primarily used on embedded devices to route network traffic. The main components are Linux, util-linux, musl, and BusyBox. All components have been optimized to be small enough to fit into the limited storage and memory available in home routers. -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenWrt

On the OS tab select Do not use any media and set the Guest OS Type to Linux and Version to 5.x - 2.6 Kernel > click Next
On the System tab click Next
On the Hard Disk tab set the Disk size to 0.001 > click Next
On the CPU tab set the number of CPU cores and the Type to host > click Next
On the Memory tab set the amount of memory to 256 MiB > click Next
On the Network tab set the Model field to VirtIO (paravirtualized), Uncheck the Firewall box > click Next
On the Confirm tab review the settings and click Finish
Select the newly created OpenWRT VM from the left navigation panel
Select Hardware from the left sub-navigation menu

Run the following commands in the terminal
# lookup the latest stable version number
regex='<strong>Current Stable Release - OpenWrt ([^/]*)<\/strong>' && response=$(curl -s https://openwrt.org) && [[ $response =~ $regex ]] && stableVersion="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
# download openwrt image
wget -O openwrt.img.gz https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/$stableVersion/targets/x86/64/openwrt-$stableVersion-x86-64-generic-ext4-combined.img.gz
# extract the openwrt img
gunzip ./openwrt.img.gz
# rename the extracted img
mv ./openwrt*.img ./openwrt.raw
# increase the raw disk to 512 MB
qemu-img resize -f raw ./openwrt.raw 512M
# import the disk to the openwrt vm
# update the vm id and storage device as needed
# usage: qm importdisk
qm importdisk 123 openwrt.raw HDD_500GB
Once the disk import completes, select the OpenWRT VM from the left navigation menu > Hardware
Double click the Unused Disk > Click the Add button
Select Options from the left sub-navigation menu
Double click Boot Order
Check the Enabled box next to the hard disk
Drag the Hard disk up in the boot order as needed, typically below the CD-ROM device

# restart network services
service network restart
# update openwrt packages
opkg update
# install the luci web ui
opkg install luci
Open a new browser tab and navigate to http://IPofVM, http://10.10.27.151 in the example
At the login screen, enter the username root and the password set above > Click the Login button
