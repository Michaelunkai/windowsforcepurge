Install Proxmox VE: Ensure that Proxmox VE is installed and running on each server. You can install Proxmox using the following commands:
 
 
# Update package lists
apt update

# Install Proxmox VE
apt install proxmox-ve
Configure Networking: Verify that each server has proper networking configured, including IP addresses, subnet masks, and gateway settings. Ensure they can communicate with each other over the network.
Create the Cluster: Use the pvecm command to create the cluster. SSH into one of the Proxmox servers and run the following command:
 
 
pvecm create <cluster_name>
Replace <cluster_name> with the desired name for your cluster.

Add Nodes to the Cluster: Once the cluster is created, you can add other Proxmox servers to it. SSH into each server and run the following command:
 
 
pvecm add <IP_address_of_existing_node>
Replace <IP_address_of_existing_node> with the IP address of a server that is already part of the cluster.

Verify Cluster Status: To verify the status of the cluster and ensure that all nodes are online, you can use the following command on any of the nodes:
 
 
pvecm status
This command will display information about the cluster, including the status of each node.



Show Current Clusters:
 
 
pvecm status
This command displays information about the current Proxmox cluster, including the cluster name, node status, quorum status, and more.
