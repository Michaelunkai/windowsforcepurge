Running a SteamOS VM in ProxMox VE
What is SteamOS?
SteamOS is our Linux-based operating system. The base system draws from Debian 8, code named Debian Jessie. Our work builds on top of the solid Debian core and optimizes it for a living room experience. Most of all, it is an open Linux platform that leaves you in full control. You can take charge of your system and install new software or content that you want. -https://store.steampowered.com/steamos/buildyourown
