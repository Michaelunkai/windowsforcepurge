Addendum - Running a MacOS Big Sur VM in ProxMox VE
This is an addendum to the tutorial on installing a MacOS Big Sur VM on Proxmox VE. The steps below will allow the VM to boot without having the OpenCore .iso mounted, as we'll be copying the EFI boot files onto the virtual hard disk.

Configuring Booting Without OpenCore Mounted
Log into the MacOSBigSur VM
Launch a web browser and download the KVM OpenCore EFI folder Download
Start LaunchPad from the dock
Search terminal > Click Terminal to launch it
Run the following commands in the terminal window
git clone https://github.com/corpnewt/MountEFI
cd MountEFI
chmod +x MountEFI.command
./MountEFI.command
Enter the number that corresponds to the OS11 drive created during the installation > Press Enter
Open a Finder window
Navigate to the mounted EFI location
If an existing EFI folder exists, rename the it to EFI.orig
Copy the KVM OpenCoreEFI folder downloaded earlier to the mounted EFI partition
Once the EFI folder is copied, shutdown the VM
Click the MacOSBigSur VM > Select Hardware from the left sub-navigation menu
Click the OpenCore Hard Disk to select it > Click Detach
Click the detached OpenCore Hard Disk to select it again > Click Remove
Right click the MacOSBigSur VM in the left navigation pane > Start
Click console in the left sub-navigation menu to verify the VM still boots into Big Sur without the OpenCore disc image mounted
