Export Proxmox VE VM for Use With VirtualBox
NOTE: In this tutorial I'll be backing up the VM to an existing network share. For details on how to add a network share to Proxmox, check out this tutorial https://youtu.be/hkrFZoiYX_0?t=47

Export the VM from Proxmox VE
Log into the Proxmox VE web UI
Select the VM from the left navigation menu
Select Backup from the left sub-navigation menu
Click the Backup now button towards the top of the page
Set the destination location, the Mode to Stop and the Compression to none > Click Backup
After the backup operation has completed, select the Proxmox node from the left navigation menu
Select Shell from the left sub-navigation menu
Change directory to the location of the vma backup file, this will vary based on your specific setup
# change directory to view mounted shares
cd /mnt/pve
# list mounted shares
ls
# cd into dump directory on the specific share, ISOs in this example
cd ISOs/dump
# list the files in the share
ls
The backup .vma file and a .log file should be displayed
Extract the .vma file using the vma command line tool
# extract the .vma
# usage: vma extract -v <vzdump-filename.vma> <destination directory>
vma extract -v filename.vma ./export
Wait for the .vma to be extracted, resulting in a .raw disk image
Converting and Importing the Disk to VirtualBox
Launch VirtualBox Manager
Create a new VM, using the same/similar hardware specifications as the Proxmox VM
Choose to not create a virtual hard disk
With the VM created, right click the VM in the left navigation menu > Show in Explorer
Copy the exported .raw disk image to the VirtualBox VM folder
Hold the SHIFT key and right click in the white space > Open PowerShell window here...
Run the following command to convert the .raw disk image to .vdi
# list .raw files
Get-ChildItem -File -Filter *.raw |Select Directory, Name, Extension
# usage: vboxmanage.exe convertfromraw <input-filename.raw> <output-filename.vdi>
Invoke-Expression ('& "'+ $Env:Programfiles +'\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" convertfromraw ".\input-filename.raw" ".\output-filename.vdi"')
Back in VirtualBox Manager, select the VM and Click Settings
Select Storage from the left navigation menu
Click Add Storage Attachment > Add Hard Disk > Choose existing disk
Click Add and browse to the newly converted .vdi file
Click OK to all open VirtualBox dialog windows
Right click the VM > Select Start > Normal
