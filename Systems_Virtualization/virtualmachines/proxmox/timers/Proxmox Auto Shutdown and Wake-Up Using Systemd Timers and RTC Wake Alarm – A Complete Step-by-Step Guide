# **Proxmox Auto Shutdown and Wake-Up Using Systemd Timers and RTC Wake Alarm â€“ A Complete Step-by-Step Guide**  

### **Introduction**  
This tutorial will guide you through setting up an automated schedule for **shutting down your Proxmox server at 22:00** and **waking it up at 16:30** daily. We will use **Systemd timers** to schedule shutdowns and **RTC (Real-Time Clock) wake alarms** to wake up the system automatically.

---

## **Step 1: Check If Your System Supports RTC Wake-Up**  

Before configuring auto wake-up, we need to verify if your **Proxmox server supports RTC wake alarms**.

### **Check RTC Device Availability**  
Run the following command to check if your system has an RTC device:

```bash
ls /sys/class/rtc
```

If you see an output like `rtc0`, then RTC is available.

### **Check If RTC Wake Alarm Works**  
Run:

```bash
cat /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm
```

- If it returns **a number** (epoch timestamp), wake alarms are supported.
- If it returns **nothing**, no wake alarm is currently set (which is normal at first).

---

## **Step 2: Manually Test RTC Wake-Up**  
We will now manually test if Proxmox can **wake up after shutting down**.

1. **Set a wake-up time 2 minutes from now**:
   ```bash
   echo $(($(date +%s) + 120)) | tee /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm
   ```

2. **Verify it was set**:
   ```bash
   cat /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm
   ```

   - If a number appears, it means the system has stored the wake-up time successfully.

3. **Shut down the system**:
   ```bash
   shutdown -h now
   ```

4. Wait for **2 minutes**.  
   - If Proxmox **turns back on automatically**, RTC wake-up is working.
   - If not, check BIOS settings (Step 3).

---

## **Step 3: Enable RTC Wake in BIOS (If It Didn't Work)**  
If your system did not wake up, RTC wake-up may be **disabled in BIOS**. Follow these steps:

1. **Reboot your Proxmox server** and enter the **BIOS/UEFI settings** (press `DEL`, `F2`, or `F12`, depending on your system).
2. Look for settings related to **RTC Wake** or **Wake on Alarm**, such as:
   - **Wake on RTC** / **Wake Timer**
   - **Resume by RTC Alarm**
   - **ACPI Wake Up**
3. **Enable** this setting and save changes.
4. Boot back into Proxmox and retry **Step 2**.

---

## **Step 4: Create a Systemd Service to Shut Down Proxmox at 22:00**  
Now that wake-up works, we will create a **Systemd service** that:
- **Shuts down Proxmox at 22:00 every day**.
- **Schedules a wake-up for 16:30 the next day**.

### **Create the Shutdown Service**  
Run:

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/shutdown-at-2200.service
```

Paste the following:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Shutdown Proxmox at 22:00 and set RTC wake-up for 16:30
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c 'next_wakeup=$(date -d "16:30 tomorrow" +%s); echo $next_wakeup > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm && shutdown -h now'
```

- `next_wakeup=$(date -d "16:30 tomorrow" +%s)` â†’ Calculates **tomorrow's** 16:30 time in epoch format.
- `echo $next_wakeup > /sys/class/rtc/rtc0/wakealarm` â†’ **Stores the wake-up time** in RTC.
- `shutdown -h now` â†’ **Shuts down the system**.

**Save and exit** (`CTRL + X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

---

## **Step 5: Create a Systemd Timer to Trigger Shutdown at 22:00**  
Now, we need to **schedule the shutdown** every day at **22:00**.

Run:

```bash
nano /etc/systemd/system/shutdown-at-2200.timer
```

Paste:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Trigger shutdown service at 22:00 daily

[Timer]
OnCalendar=*-*-* 22:00:00
Persistent=true
Unit=shutdown-at-2200.service

[Install]
WantedBy=timers.target
```

- `OnCalendar=*-*-* 22:00:00` â†’ Runs **every day at 22:00**.
- `Unit=shutdown-at-2200.service` â†’ Calls the shutdown service.

**Save and exit**.

---

## **Step 6: Enable and Start the Timer**  
Run:

```bash
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable shutdown-at-2200.timer
systemctl start shutdown-at-2200.timer
```

---

## **Step 7: Verify That the Timer Is Running**  
Run:

```bash
systemctl list-timers --all | grep shutdown
```

This should show an entry that schedules **shutdown at 22:00**.

---

## **Step 8: Remove Everything (If Needed)**  
If you want to **remove** the automated shutdown and wake-up, run:

```bash
systemctl stop shutdown-at-2200.timer && systemctl disable shutdown-at-2200.timer && rm -f /etc/systemd/system/shutdown-at-2200.{service,timer} && systemctl daemon-reload
```

---

## **Final Result: How It Works**
âœ… **Every day at 22:00**, Proxmox **shuts down** and schedules a **wake-up at 16:30 tomorrow**.  
âœ… **At 16:30**, Proxmox **automatically turns on**, ready for use.

ðŸŽ¯ **Done! Your Proxmox server now has a reliable auto-shutdown and wake-up schedule!** ðŸš€
