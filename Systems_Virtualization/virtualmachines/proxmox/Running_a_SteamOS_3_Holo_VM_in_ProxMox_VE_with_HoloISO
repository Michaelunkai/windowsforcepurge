Running a SteamOS 3 Holo VM in ProxMox VE with HoloISO
What is HoloISO?
[HoloISO] attempts to bring the Steam Deck's SteamOS Holo into a generic, installable format, and provide a close-to-official SteamOS experience. Main point of this project focuses in re-implementing proprietary (as in runs-only-on-deck) components that Steam client, OS itself, gamescope and user-created applications for Deck rely on. -https://github.com/theVakhovskeIsTaken/holoiso
