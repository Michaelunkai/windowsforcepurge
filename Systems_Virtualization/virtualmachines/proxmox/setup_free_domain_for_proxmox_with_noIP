To set up a free domain for your Proxmox server and link it to your local IP address, you can use a service like No-IP. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to get you started:

Step 1: Register for a Free No-IP Account
Go to No-IP's website.
Sign up for a free account.
Confirm your email address.
Step 2: Create a Free Hostname
After logging into No-IP, go to "Dynamic DNS" and click "Create Hostname".
Choose a hostname (e.g., myproxmox) and select a free domain from the list (e.g., ddns.net).
Enter your current public IP address (you can find it by searching "What is my IP" on Google).
Click "Create Hostname".
Step 3: Install No-IP DUC (Dynamic Update Client) on Your Proxmox Server
SSH into your Proxmox server.

Download and install the No-IP DUC client.

cd /usr/local/src
sudo wget http://www.no-ip.com/client/linux/noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
sudo tar xf noip-duc-linux.tar.gz
cd noip-2.1.9-1
sudo make
sudo make install
During the installation, you'll be prompted to enter your No-IP account email and password. You'll also choose the update interval (default is 30 minutes).

Step 4: Configure No-IP DUC
Start the No-IP DUC client.

sudo /usr/local/bin/noip2
To check the status of No-IP DUC, use:

sudo /usr/local/bin/noip2 -S
To configure No-IP DUC to start on boot, create a startup script.

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/noip2.service
Add the following content to the file:

[Unit]
Description=No-IP Dynamic DNS Update Client
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=forking
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/noip2

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
Save and exit the file (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).

Enable and start the service:

sudo systemctl enable noip2
sudo systemctl start noip2
Step 5: Access Your Proxmox Server Using the Domain
Open your web browser.
Navigate to https://yourhostname.ddns.net:8006 (replace yourhostname.ddns.net with the hostname you created).
