A script designed to allow for the creation of one of the many free LXC templates. Great for creating system LXCs.
The script creates a *.creds file in the Proxmox root directory with the password of the newly created LXC.
Please take note that if you plan to use this script for creating TurnKey LXCs, you'll need to modify the hostname after creation.

To create a new Proxmox VE Template LXC, run the command below in the Proxmox VE Shell.

bash -c "$(wget -qLO - https://github.com/tteck/Proxmox/raw/main/misc/all-templates.sh)"
