Schedule Proxmox VM Startup and Shutdown with Cron
What is Cron?
The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of their own so that processes are run on their behalf. -https://packages.debian.org/stable/cron
Log into Proxmox VE either via SSH or the web based shell
Run the following commands in the terminal
# verify the location of qm
# should output /usr/sbin/qm
which qm
# list the configured vms
qm list
Note the VMID of the target VM(s)
Determine the startup and shutdown schedule requirements for each target VM
Convert the startup and shutdown schedules to cron format, https://crontab.guru/ is a great utility to visualize them
Continue with the following commands in the terminal
# edit the cron table file
crontab -e
# if prompted, select nano from the list of editors
At the bottom of the file, add an entry for the start and stop of each target VM in the following format
<%cron schedule%> /usr/sbin/qm <%start|shutdown%> <%VMID%>
55 6 * * * /usr/sbin/qm start 100
5 23 * * * /usr/sbin/qm shutdown 100

Press CTRL+O, Enter, CTRL+X to write the changes and close nano
In the example above, VM 100 will be started at 6:55 AM and shutdown at 11:05 PM everyday
Cron schedules can be extremely flexible with some creativity, some examples:
6:55 AM only on weekdays
55 6 * * 1-5 /usr/sbin/qm start 100
9:00 AM only on weekends
0 9 * * 6,0 /usr/sbin/qm start 100
7:00 AM only on Monday, Wednesday and Friday
0 7 * * 1,3,5 /usr/sbin/qm start 100

Linux Containers (lxc) can be controlled via the pct command
55 6 * * 1-5 /usr/sbin/pct start 103
0 9 * * 6,0 /usr/sbin/pct start 103
0 7 * * 1,3,5 /usr/sbin/pct start 103
