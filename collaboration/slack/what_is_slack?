4. **File Sharing**: Users can share files directly within Slack, making it easy to collaborate on documents, images, and other media.

5. **Search**: Slack provides powerful search functionality, allowing users to find past messages, files, and conversations quickly.

6. **Notifications**: Users can customize notifications to stay informed about important messages and updates without being overwhelmed by non-essential notifications.

7. **Apps and Bots**: Slack supports various apps and bots that can automate tasks, provide information, and enhance the functionality of the platform.
