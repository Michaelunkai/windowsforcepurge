Trello is a web-based project management tool that allows users to organize tasks, projects, and workflows using boards, lists, and cards. It is commonly used for task management, collaboration, and tracking progress in various projects. Each board in Trello represents a project, with lists for different stages or categories, and cards representing individual tasks or items within those lists. Users can assign tasks, set deadlines, add attachments, and communicate with team members within the platform.
