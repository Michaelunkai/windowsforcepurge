Sure, here's a step-by-step guide to configure and use Cloud Foundry for application deployment on Ubuntu.

### Step 1: Install Cloud Foundry CLI
1. Open your terminal.
2. Update your package list:
    ``` 
    sudo apt-get update
    ```
3. Install Cloud Foundry CLI using the package manager:
    ``` 
    wget -O cf-cli.deb "https://packages.cloudfoundry.org/stable?release=debian64&source=github"
    sudo dpkg -i cf-cli.deb
    ```

### Step 2: Log in to Cloud Foundry
1. In the terminal, run the login command:
    ``` 
    cf login
    ```
2. When prompted, enter your API endpoint (e.g., `https://api.run.pivotal.io` for Pivotal Web Services or your specific endpoint for another Cloud Foundry instance).
3. Enter your email and password when prompted.

### Step 3: Target an Organization and Space
1. List available organizations:
    ``` 
    cf orgs
    ```
2. Target a specific organization:
    ``` 
    cf target -o YOUR_ORG
    ```
3. List available spaces within the targeted organization:
    ``` 
    cf spaces
    ```
4. Target a specific space:
    ``` 
    cf target -s YOUR_SPACE
    ```

### Step 4: Prepare Your Application for Deployment
1. Ensure your application has a `manifest.yml` file in the root directory. This file defines how the application should be deployed. Example content for a Node.js app:
    ``` 
    ---
    applications:
    - name: my-app
      memory: 512M
      instances: 1
      path: .
      buildpacks:
        - nodejs_buildpack
    ```
2. Make sure all necessary application files are in the directory, including dependencies (e.g., `package.json` for Node.js).

### Step 5: Deploy the Application
1. In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your application and `manifest.yml` file:
    ``` 
    cd /path/to/your/app
    ```
2. Push the application to Cloud Foundry:
    ``` 
    cf push
    ```
3. Wait for the deployment process to complete. Cloud Foundry will output logs and status messages during this process.

### Step 6: Verify the Deployment
1. Once the deployment is complete, you can view your running applications:
    ``` 
    cf apps
    ```
2. Check the URL provided for your application and open it in a web browser to ensure it's running as expected.

### Step 7: Managing Your Application
1. To scale your application, you can increase the number of instances:
    ``` 
    cf scale my-app -i 2
    ```
2. To view logs for your application:
    ``` 
    cf logs my-app --recent
    ```
3. To stop your application:
    ``` 
    cf stop my-app
    ```
4. To start your application again:
    ``` 
    cf start my-app
    ```
5. To delete your application:
    ``` 
    cf delete my-app
    ```
