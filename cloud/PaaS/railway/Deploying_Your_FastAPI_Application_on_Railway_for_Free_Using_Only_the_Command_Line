# Step-by-Step Guide to Deploying Your FastAPI Application on Railway for Free Using Only the Command Line

### Prerequisites
1. **Railway CLI:** Make sure you have the Railway CLI installed. You can install it with the following command:
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://railway.app/install.sh | sh
    ```
2. **Python:** Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.

### Steps

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**
    ```bash
    cd /mnt/c/study/programming/python/apps/Media2Text/speachtotext/7
    ```

2. **Create a `requirements.txt` File:**
    ```bash
    echo "fastapi" > requirements.txt
    echo "uvicorn" >> requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Create a `Procfile`:**
    ```bash
    echo "web: uvicorn app:app --host=0.0.0.0 --port=\$PORT" > Procfile
    ```

4. **Create a `runtime.txt` File:**
    This ensures that Railway uses the correct Python version.
    ```bash
    echo "python-3.9.6" > runtime.txt
    ```

5. **Initialize a Railway Project:**
    ```bash
    railway init
    ```

6. **Deploy the Application:**
    ```bash
    railway up
    ```

7. **Access Your Application:**
    After deployment, Railway will provide a URL where your application is hosted. You can find this URL in the output of the `railway up` command or by logging into the Railway web dashboard.

### Additional Steps (if necessary)
1. **Logging into Railway:**
    ```bash
    railway login
    ```
    This command will prompt you to log in through a web browser.

2. **Linking the Project:**
    If you have already created a project on Railway through their web interface, you can link it with the following command:
    ```bash
    railway link
    ```

### Notes
- Ensure your `app.py` file contains a FastAPI application instance named `app`.
- The `railway up` command will handle the creation and deployment of your project, including setting up environment variables.

Your FastAPI application should now be running on Railway. If you encounter any issues or need further customization, you can refer to the [Railway documentation](https://docs.railway.app/) for more detailed instructions.
