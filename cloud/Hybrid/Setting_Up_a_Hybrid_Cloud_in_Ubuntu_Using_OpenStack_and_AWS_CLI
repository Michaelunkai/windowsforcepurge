Certainly! Here's the tutorial remade using OpenStack, an open-source cloud platform, instead of VMware Cloud on AWS.

### **Comprehensive Guide: Setting Up a Hybrid Cloud in Ubuntu Using OpenStack and AWS CLI**

---

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a hybrid cloud in Ubuntu using OpenStack alongside AWS CLI. You will learn how to install the necessary tools, configure OpenStack and AWS, and deploy workloads seamlessly across both platforms.

---

### **Step 1: Install Required Tools on Ubuntu**

Start by installing OpenStack CLI tools and AWS CLI on your Ubuntu system:

  
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-openstackclient awscli

This command installs the OpenStack CLI toolset (`python3-openstackclient`) and AWS CLI.

---

### **Step 2: Configure AWS CLI**

Configure AWS CLI to interact with AWS services:

  
aws configure

Provide your AWS credentials and preferred settings when prompted.

---

### **Step 3: Set Up OpenStack**

Assuming you have an OpenStack environment ready, you need to source your OpenStack credentials:

  
source <path-to-openstack-credentials>

Replace `<path-to-openstack-credentials>` with the path to your OpenStack credentials file.

---

### **Step 4: Configure Networking for Hybrid Cloud**

Set up a network in OpenStack that connects to your AWS environment:

  
openstack network create <network-name>
openstack subnet create <subnet-name> --network <network-name> --subnet-range <subnet-range>

Replace `<network-name>`, `<subnet-name>`, and `<subnet-range>` with your specific network configurations.

---

### **Step 5: Create an Instance in OpenStack**

Launch a new instance in OpenStack to start your hybrid cloud:

  
openstack server create --flavor <flavor-id> --image <image-id> --network <network-id> --key-name <key-name> <server-name>

Replace `<flavor-id>`, `<image-id>`, `<network-id>`, `<key-name>`, and `<server-name>` with your specific details.

---

### **Step 6: Set Up AWS Resources**

Now, create a corresponding instance in AWS:

  
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id <AMI_ID> --count 1 --instance-type <INSTANCE_TYPE> --key-name <KEY_NAME> --security-group-ids <SECURITY_GROUP_ID> --subnet-id <SUBNET_ID>

Replace the placeholders with appropriate AWS configurations.

---

### **Step 7: Integrate OpenStack and AWS Networks**

Configure VPN or Direct Connect for network integration between OpenStack and AWS:

  
# OpenStack VPN Configuration
openstack vpn create ...

# AWS VPN Configuration
aws ec2 create-vpn-connection ...

Use specific commands for setting up VPNs or Direct Connect depending on your requirements.

---

### **Step 8: Deploy and Manage Workloads**

Deploy and manage workloads across your hybrid cloud. Utilize OpenStack Horizon and AWS Management Console for GUI management, or continue using CLI tools for automation.

---

### **Step 9: Monitor Your Hybrid Environment**

Use monitoring tools like OpenStackâ€™s Ceilometer or AWS CloudWatch to keep track of your resources and workloads.

---

### **Step 10: Clean Up Resources**

Terminate instances and clean up your hybrid setup when not needed:

  
openstack server delete <server-id>
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids <instance-id>

Replace `<server-id>` and `<instance-id>` with your specific instance IDs.

---

This setup leverages the flexibility and open-source benefits of OpenStack along with the robust infrastructure of AWS. By following this guide, you can establish a scalable and efficient hybrid cloud environment in Ubuntu, combining the strengths of both OpenStack and AWS.
