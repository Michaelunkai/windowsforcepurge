Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) is a cloud service model that provides developers with ready-to-use backend infrastructure, allowing them to focus on building the frontend and core functionality of applications without worrying about managing servers, databases, or other backend components. BaaS typically offers services like:

- **Database management** (e.g., real-time databases, cloud storage)
- **User authentication** and authorization
- **Cloud functions** (serverless computing)
- **Push notifications**
- **APIs** for interacting with backend services
- **File storage**
  
BaaS simplifies the development process, especially for mobile and web apps, by abstracting away the complexity of backend management.
