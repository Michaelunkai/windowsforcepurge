1. Create Lambda Function:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the Lambda dashboard.
Click on "Create function."
Choose a function name, runtime, and execution role.
Write your function code or choose a pre-built blueprint.
Configure triggers and permissions as needed.
Click "Create function" to create your Lambda function.
2. Invoke Lambda Function:

After creating the Lambda function, navigate to its details page.
Find the function's ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for later use.
Test the function using the "Test" button or by invoking it through an event source.
Monitor function invocations and performance metrics in the Lambda dashboard or using CloudWatch.
3. Add Lambda Function to EC2:

Go to the EC2 dashboard.
Select the EC2 instance you want to integrate with Lambda.
Create an IAM role with permissions to invoke the Lambda function.
Attach the IAM role to the EC2 instance.
Use the AWS SDK or CLI to invoke the Lambda function from the EC2 instance code.
4. Test Integration:

Update the EC2 instance code to invoke the Lambda function.
Test the integration by triggering the EC2 instance code.
Monitor the function invocations and performance from the Lambda dashboard and CloudWatch.
5. Compare Performance:

Before integrating Lambda, measure the performance of your application running on the EC2 instance.
After integrating Lambda, measure the performance again.
Compare metrics such as response time, throughput, and resource utilization to assess the impact of Lambda integration on your application's performance.
By following these steps, you'll be able to create a Lambda function, invoke it, integrate it with an EC2 instance, and compare the performance before and after integration.
