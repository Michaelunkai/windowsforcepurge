1. Create a Load Balancer:

Go to the AWS Management Console.
Navigate to the EC2 dashboard.
In the left-hand menu, under "Load Balancing," select "Load Balancers."
Click on "Create Load Balancer."
Choose the type of load balancer you want (Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, or Classic Load Balancer) and click "Create."
Follow the prompts to configure your load balancer, including specifying a name, selecting availability zones, configuring listeners, and configuring security settings.
Once configured, click "Create" to create your load balancer.
2. Add EC2 Instance to Load Balancer:

After creating the load balancer, navigate to its details page.
Under the "Description" tab, note down the DNS name of the load balancer.
Go to the EC2 dashboard.
Select the EC2 instance you want to add to the load balancer.
In the bottom pane, under "Description," find the "Security groups" and click on the associated security group.
In the security group details, click "Edit inbound rules."
Add a new rule allowing traffic from the load balancer's security group, typically on the port(s) your application listens to.
Save the changes.
Navigate back to the load balancer details page.
Under the "Listeners" tab, click "Add listener" and configure it to match the port(s) and protocol of your application.
Under the "Targets" tab, click "Edit" and add the EC2 instance(s) you want to register with the load balancer.
Save the changes.
3. Test the Load Balancer:

Open a web browser or any HTTP client.
Enter the DNS name of the load balancer as the URL.
Send requests to the load balancer.
Monitor the traffic distribution across the EC2 instances in the load balancer from the EC2 dashboard or using CloudWatch metrics.
4. Compare EC2 Instance Performance:

Before adding the load balancer, measure the performance of your application running directly on the EC2 instance(s).
After adding the load balancer, measure the performance again.
Compare metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rates to assess the impact of the load balancer on your application's performance.
By following these steps, you'll be able to create a load balancer, add it to an existing EC2 instance, and compare the performance before and after implementing the load balancer.
