 Clean Up to Avoid Extra Costs
If you no longer need the EFS file system and want to avoid any extra costs, follow these steps to delete everything:

Unmount the File System
 
 
sudo umount /mnt/efs
Delete the Mount Target
List your mount targets to get their IDs:

 
 
aws efs describe-mount-targets --file-system-id fs-12345678
Then delete the mount target:

 
 
aws efs delete-mount-target --mount-target-id mt-12345678
Replace mt-12345678 with your mount target ID.

Delete the EFS File System
 
 
aws efs delete-file-system --file-system-id fs-12345678
Replace fs-12345678 with your EFS file system ID.

Delete the Security Group (if created specifically for EFS)
If you created a specific security group for EFS, you might want to delete it:

 
 
aws ec2 delete-security-group --group-id sg-12345678
Replace sg-12345678 with your security group ID.
