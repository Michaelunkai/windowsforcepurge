I'd be happy to teach you how to configure AWS KMS for Auto-Unseal using the AWS CLI. This process involves several steps:

1. Create a KMS key
2. Create an IAM policy for Vault to use the KMS key
3. Attach the policy to an IAM role
4. Configure Vault to use KMS for auto-unseal

Let's go through these steps:

1. Create a KMS key:

aws kms create-key --description "Vault Auto-Unseal Key" --region your-region

Note the KeyId and Arn in the output. You'll need these later.

2. Create an IAM policy:

Create a file named `vault-kms-policy.json` with the following content:

 json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VaultKMSUnseal",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "kms:Encrypt",
        "kms:Decrypt",
        "kms:DescribeKey"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:kms:your-region:your-account-id:key/your-key-id"
    }
  ]
}

Replace `your-region`, `your-account-id`, and `your-key-id` with your actual values.

Now create the policy:

aws iam create-policy --policy-name VaultKMSUnsealPolicy --policy-document file://vault-kms-policy.json

3. Attach the policy to an IAM role:

If you don't have a role for Vault yet, create one:

aws iam create-role --role-name VaultRole --assume-role-policy-document '{"Version":"2012-10-17","Statement":[{"Effect":"Allow","Principal":{"Service":"ec2.amazonaws.com"},"Action":"sts:AssumeRole"}]}'

Attach the policy to the role:

aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name VaultRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::your-account-id:policy/VaultKMSUnsealPolicy

4. Configure Vault:

In your Vault configuration file (usually `config.hcl`), add the following:

 hcl
seal "awskms" {
  region     = "your-region"
  kms_key_id = "your-key-id"
}

Replace `your-region` and `your-key-id` with your actual values.

That's it! You've now configured AWS KMS for Auto-Unseal using the AWS CLI. When you start Vault, it will use this KMS key for auto-unsealing.

Would you like me to explain any part of this process in more detail?
