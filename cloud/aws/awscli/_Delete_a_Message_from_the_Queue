Delete a Message from the Queue
Once you receive and process a message, you should delete it from the queue to prevent it from being received again.

 
 
aws sqs delete-message --queue-url <QueueUrl> --receipt-handle <ReceiptHandle>
The ReceiptHandle is obtained from the output of the receive-message command.
