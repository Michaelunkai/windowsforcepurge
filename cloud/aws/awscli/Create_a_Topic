 Create a Topic
A topic is a communication channel to send messages and subscribe to.

 
 
aws sns create-topic --name my-topic
This command will return an ARN (Amazon Resource Name) for the topic, which looks something like this:

json
 
{
    "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:123456789012:my-topic"
}
