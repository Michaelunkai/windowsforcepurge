Creating a domain in Amazon Route 53 using the AWS CLI involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you through the process.

Prerequisites
AWS CLI: Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed. If not, install it from here.
AWS CLI Configuration: Configure your AWS CLI with your AWS credentials. Run the following command and follow the prompts:
aws configure
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Create a Hosted Zone
A hosted zone is a container for records that define how you want to route traffic for a domain and its subdomains.

aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name yourdomain.com --caller-reference unique-string
yourdomain.com: Replace with your domain name.
unique-string: Replace with a unique string, such as a timestamp.
Example:

aws route53 create-hosted-zone --name example.com --caller-reference 20240604-unique
2. Register a Domain
If you haven't registered your domain yet, you can register it through Route 53. This step requires you to have a domain registration.

aws route53domains register-domain --domain-name yourdomain.com --duration-in-years 1 --admin-contact file://admin-contact.json --registrant-contact file://registrant-contact.json --tech-contact file://tech-contact.json
You'll need JSON files for the contact details. Here is a sample for admin-contact.json:

{
  "FirstName": "John",
  "LastName": "Doe",
  "ContactType": "PERSON",
  "OrganizationName": "Your Organization",
  "AddressLine1": "123 Any Street",
  "City": "Any City",
  "State": "Any State",
  "CountryCode": "US",
  "ZipCode": "12345",
  "PhoneNumber": "+1.1234567890",
  "Email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
Ensure you have similar files for registrant-contact.json and tech-contact.json.

3. Create DNS Records
After the hosted zone is created, you need to create DNS records. Below is an example to create an A record.

Create a JSON file, change-batch.json, with the following content:

{
  "Comment": "Creating A record for example.com",
  "Changes": [
    {
      "Action": "CREATE",
      "ResourceRecordSet": {
        "Name": "example.com",
        "Type": "A",
        "TTL": 300,
        "ResourceRecords": [
          {
            "Value": "192.0.2.1"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
Run the following command to create the record:

aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id Z1234567890ABCDEFG --change-batch file://change-batch.json
Replace Z1234567890ABCDEFG with the actual Hosted Zone ID you received when creating the hosted zone.

4. Verify DNS Propagation
You can verify the DNS records using tools like nslookup or dig:

nslookup example.com
or

dig example.com
Summary
Create a Hosted Zone: aws route53 create-hosted-zone.
Register a Domain: aws route53domains register-domain.
Create DNS Records: aws route53 change-resource-record-sets.
