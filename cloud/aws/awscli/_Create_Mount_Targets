Create Mount Targets
You need to create mount targets in the subnets of your VPC. First, list your VPCs and subnets to get their IDs:

 
 
aws ec2 describe-vpcs
aws ec2 describe-subnets
Then, create mount targets for your EFS file system:

 
 
aws efs create-mount-target --file-system-id fs-12345678 --subnet-id subnet-12345678 --security-groups sg-12345678
Replace fs-12345678 with your EFS file system ID, subnet-12345678 with your subnet ID, and sg-12345678 with your security group ID.
