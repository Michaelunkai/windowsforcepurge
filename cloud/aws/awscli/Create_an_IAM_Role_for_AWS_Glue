Create an IAM Role for AWS Glue
First, create an IAM role that AWS Glue can assume to perform its tasks. This role should have policies that allow access to the necessary resources, such as S3.

 
 
aws iam create-role --role-name GlueServiceRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json
trust-policy.json should look like this:

json
 
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "glue.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
Attach the managed policy for AWS Glue:

 
 
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name GlueServiceRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSGlueServiceRole
