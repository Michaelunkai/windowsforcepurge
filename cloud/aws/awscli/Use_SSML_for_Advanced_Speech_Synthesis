 Use SSML for Advanced Speech Synthesis
Amazon Polly supports SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) for more control over speech. For example, you can adjust the speech rate, add pauses, and more.

Command to Synthesize Speech with SSML:

 
 
aws polly synthesize-speech \
--output-format mp3 \
--voice-id Joanna \
--text-type ssml \
--text "<speak><break time='1s'/>Hello, this is a sample text with a pause.</speak>" \
output_with_pause.mp3
This command creates an MP3 file with a 1-second pause before the speech starts.
