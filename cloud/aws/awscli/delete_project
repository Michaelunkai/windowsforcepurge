To delete an Amplify project using the AWS CLI, follow these steps:

List the Amplify apps (you've already done this):

 
 
aws amplify list-apps --query 'apps[*].name'
Find the App ID for the project you want to delete (in this case, mystudyfolderinweb):

 
 
aws amplify list-apps --query 'apps[?name==`mystudyfolderinweb`].appId'
This command will return the App ID of mystudyfolderinweb.

Delete the Amplify app using the App ID obtained in the previous step:

 
 
aws amplify delete-app --app-id <your-app-id>
Replace <your-app-id> with the actual App ID of mystudyfolderinweb.

Hereâ€™s how it looks step-by-step:

List the apps:

 
 
aws amplify list-apps --query 'apps[*].name'
Get the App ID for mystudyfolderinweb:

 
 
aws amplify list-apps --query 'apps[?name==`mystudyfolderinweb`].appId'
Delete the app:

 
 
aws amplify delete-app --app-id <your-app-id>
Replace <your-app-id> with the App ID obtained from step 2.
