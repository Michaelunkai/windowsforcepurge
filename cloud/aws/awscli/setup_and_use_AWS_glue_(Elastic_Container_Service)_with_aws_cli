Setting up and using AWS Glue (Elastic Container Service) with the AWS CLI involves several steps, including creating an IAM role, setting up the Glue service, creating a Glue job, and executing the job. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

### Prerequisites
1. **AWS CLI Installed**: Ensure that the AWS CLI is installed and configured with appropriate permissions.
2. **IAM Role**: You need an IAM role with necessary permissions for Glue and S3 access.

### Step 1: Create an IAM Role for AWS Glue
First, create an IAM role that AWS Glue can assume to perform its tasks. This role should have policies that allow access to the necessary resources, such as S3.

  
aws iam create-role --role-name GlueServiceRole --assume-role-policy-document file://trust-policy.json

`trust-policy.json` should look like this:
 json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "glue.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}

Attach the managed policy for AWS Glue:
  
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name GlueServiceRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSGlueServiceRole

### Step 2: Create an S3 Bucket
Create an S3 bucket to store scripts and data:
  
aws s3 mb s3://your-glue-bucket

### Step 3: Upload Script to S3
Upload your ETL script to the S3 bucket:
  
aws s3 cp your-etl-script.py s3://your-glue-bucket/scripts/your-etl-script.py

### Step 4: Create a Glue Job
Create a Glue job using the AWS CLI:
  
aws glue create-job --name your-glue-job --role GlueServiceRole --command '{"Name": "glueetl", "ScriptLocation": "s3://your-glue-bucket/scripts/your-etl-script.py", "PythonVersion": "3"}' --default-arguments '{"--job-bookmark-option": "job-bookmark-enable"}' --region your-region

### Step 5: Start the Glue Job
Start the Glue job:
  
aws glue start-job-run --job-name your-glue-job

### Step 6: Monitor the Glue Job
You can monitor the status of your Glue job run using the following command:
  
aws glue get-job-run --job-name your-glue-job --run-id your-job-run-id

### Step 7: Create and Manage a Glue Crawler (Optional)
If you need to create a Glue Crawler to populate the Glue Data Catalog, you can do so with the following steps:

1. **Create a Glue Crawler**:
      
    aws glue create-crawler --name your-crawler --role GlueServiceRole --database-name your-database --targets "{\"S3Targets\": [{\"Path\": \"s3://your-glue-bucket/data/\"}]}"

2. **Start the Crawler**:
      
    aws glue start-crawler --name your-crawler

3. **Get Crawler Status**:
      
    aws glue get-crawler --name your-crawler

### Step 8: Cleanup
After you are done, make sure to clean up the resources to avoid unnecessary charges:
  
aws glue delete-job --job-name your-glue-job
aws glue delete-crawler --name your-crawler
aws s3 rm s3://your-glue-bucket --recursive
aws iam detach-role-policy --role-name GlueServiceRole --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSGlueServiceRole
aws iam delete-role --role-name GlueServiceRole

This guide provides a basic overview of setting up and using AWS Glue with the AWS CLI. You can customize the commands based on your specific needs and the complexity of your ETL processes.
