### Troubleshooting AccessDenied Error for IAM `ListUsers` Operation

#### **Problem Statement:**
You are encountering an `AccessDenied` error when trying to list IAM users using the AWS CLI command `aws iam list-users --output table`. The error message indicates that the IAM user `mym` is not authorized to perform the `iam:ListUsers` operation due to a lack of identity-based policy permissions.

#### **Steps to Resolve the Issue:**

1. **Log in to the AWS Management Console**
   - Open your web browser and go to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
   - Enter your credentials to log in. Make sure you use an account with administrative privileges or one that has permission to modify IAM policies.

2. **Navigate to the IAM Dashboard**
   - Once logged in, locate and click on **Services** at the top of the page.
   - Under the **Security, Identity, & Compliance** section, click on **IAM** to open the IAM dashboard.

3. **Locate the IAM User**
   - In the IAM dashboard, select **Users** from the left-hand navigation menu.
   - Find and click on the user `mym` (or the specific IAM user who encountered the error).

4. **Attach a Policy with the Required Permissions**
   - After selecting the user, go to the **Permissions** tab.
   - Click on the **Add permissions** button.

   **To Attach an Existing Policy:**
   - Choose **Attach policies directly**.
   - In the search bar, type `AdministratorAccess` or another policy that includes the `iam:ListUsers` permission.
   - Check the box next to the policy and click **Next: Review**.
   - Review the permissions that will be added and click **Add permissions** to apply them.

   **To Create and Attach a Custom Policy:**
   - Select **Create policy** from the **Add permissions** page.
   - Switch to the **JSON** tab.
   - Copy and paste the following JSON policy, which grants `iam:ListUsers` permission:

      json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17",
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
             "iam:ListUsers"
           ],
           "Resource": "*"
         }
       ]
     }
   - Click **Review policy**.
   - Enter a name for the policy (e.g., `ListUsersPolicy`) and provide a description if desired.
   - Click **Create policy** to finalize the policy creation.
   - Return to the **Add permissions** page.
   - Choose **Attach policies directly**.
   - Search for the newly created policy by name, check the box next to it, and click **Next: Review**.
   - Review the permissions and click **Add permissions** to apply the new policy.

5. **Verify Permissions**
   - To confirm that the policy has been applied correctly, go back to the **Users** section, select the user `mym`, and review the attached policies under the **Permissions** tab.

6. **Test the Command Again**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Run the following AWS CLI command to verify if the issue is resolved:

       
     aws iam list-users --output table

   - If permissions have been set correctly, the command should now execute successfully without encountering the `AccessDenied` error.

#### **Additional Tips:**
- Ensure that any permission changes comply with your organization's security policies and best practices.
- If you still face issues, double-check for any permission boundaries or service control policies that might be restricting access.

By following these steps, you should be able to address the `AccessDenied` error and successfully perform the `iam:ListUsers` operation.
