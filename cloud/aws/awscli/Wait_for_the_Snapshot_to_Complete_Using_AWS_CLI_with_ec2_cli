Wait for the Snapshot to Complete Using AWS CLI
You need to wait until the snapshot associated with the AMI is fully created and available. You can check the status of the snapshot by using the following commands:

Get the Snapshot ID:

 
 
aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --query 'Images[0].BlockDeviceMappings[0].Ebs.SnapshotId' --output text
Check the Snapshot Status:

 
 
aws ec2 describe-snapshots --snapshot-ids snap-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx --query 'Snapshots[0].State' --output text
Replace snap-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with the actual Snapshot ID. The state should be completed before you can use it to launch an instance.
