Great question 👍 Let’s break it down clearly.

### 🔹 What makes something a **VPS**?

A **VPS (Virtual Private Server)** is:

* A **virtual machine** running on a physical server.
* Provides **dedicated CPU, RAM, and storage allocation** (not shared like simple hosting).
* Runs a **full operating system** (Linux, Windows, etc.), where you have **root/admin access**.
* Lets you install **any software, services, or applications** like on a real server.
* Billed typically as **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**.

👉 In short: If you can SSH/RDP into it and manage it like your own server → it’s a **VPS**.

### 🔹 What is **NOT a VPS**?

Services that don’t give you full server-level control fall into other categories:

* **PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)** – You only deploy code/apps, the platform manages the server (e.g., Koyeb, Heroku).
* **BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service)** – Provides APIs/databases but no server access (e.g., Firebase).
* **SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)** – Ready-made software delivered over the web (e.g., Google Workspace, pCloud).
* **Serverless / FaaS** – You run functions without managing servers (e.g., AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers).
* **Storage/CDN** – Cloud storage or content delivery, no compute power (e.g., Backblaze B2, pCloud, Cloudflare).
* **Frameworks/Tools** – Software for managing clouds (e.g., OpenStack, Cloud Foundry, ccoctl).

✅ **Example VPS**:
DigitalOcean Droplet → You get Ubuntu 22.04, 2 CPU cores, 2GB RAM. You can SSH, install Apache, MySQL, Docker, etc.

❌ **Example NOT VPS**:
Koyeb app → You just push your code, it runs, but you cannot configure the underlying OS or install system software.

Would you like me to also make a **visual table** comparing VPS vs PaaS vs SaaS vs Serverless vs Storage → so it’s super easy to spot the difference?
