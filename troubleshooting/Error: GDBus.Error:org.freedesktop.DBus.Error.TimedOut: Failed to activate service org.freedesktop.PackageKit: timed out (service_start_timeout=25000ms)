To fix the `GDBus.Error:org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.TimedOut` issue related to `org.freedesktop.PackageKit` in WSL2 Ubuntu (where systemd and D-Bus often have issues), you can use this one-liner to disable `PackageKit` and avoid the timeout error:

```bash
sudo apt purge -y packagekit && echo "âœ” PackageKit removed to avoid D-Bus timeout issue"
```

### Why this works:

* WSL2 doesn't support `systemd` fully by default unless explicitly enabled.
* `PackageKit` relies on D-Bus and systemd services which can hang or fail in WSL2.
* Removing `packagekit` eliminates the dependency on a service that won't work properly in this environment.

Let me know if you want a solution that enables `systemd` properly inside WSL2 instead.
