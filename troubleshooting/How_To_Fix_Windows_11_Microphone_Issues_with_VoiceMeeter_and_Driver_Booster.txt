### **Part 3: Advanced Audio Control with VoiceMeeter**

VoiceMeeter is a virtual audio mixer that provides advanced control over your audio devices, allowing you to route audio from any source to any destination.

**Step 1: Download and Install VoiceMeeter**
1.  Go to the VB-Audio website and download the VoiceMeeter installer (the standard version is sufficient for most cases).
2.  Unzip the downloaded file.
3.  Right-click the installer (`VoiceMeeterSetup.exe`) and select "Run as administrator".
4.  Follow the installation prompts.
5.  **Crucially, restart your computer after installation.** This is required to register the new virtual audio devices.

**Step 2: Configure VoiceMeeter and Windows Sound Settings**
1.  **Set VoiceMeeter as the Default Device:**
    *   Right-click the speaker icon in the taskbar and select "Sound settings".
    *   Under "Output", set **VoiceMeeter Input (VB-Audio VoiceMeeter VAIO)** as your default device.
    *   Under "Input", set **VoiceMeeter Output (VB-Audio VoiceMeeter VAIO)** as your default device.
2.  **Launch and Configure VoiceMeeter:**
    *   Open the VoiceMeeter application.
    *   **Column 1 (HARDWARE INPUT 1):** Click "Select Input Device" and choose your physical microphone from the list (e.g., WDM: Microphone (Realtek Audio) or MME: Microphone (USB PnP Device)).
    *   **Column (HARDWARE OUT):** In the top-right corner, click the "A1" button and select your primary output device (e.g., your headphones or speakers, using the WDM or MME driver).
3.  **Route Your Microphone:**
    *   In the "HARDWARE INPUT 1" column where you selected your mic, ensure the "B" button is enabled (lit up). This sends your microphone's audio to the virtual output. The "A" button can be disabled if you don't want to hear yourself (sidetone/monitoring).

**Step 3: Configure Your Application**
1.  Open the application where you want to use your microphone (e.g., Discord, OBS, Audacity, Zoom).
2.  Go to its audio/voice settings.
3.  Set the **Input Device** to **VoiceMeeter Output (VB-Audio VoiceMeeter VAIO)**.

**Step 4: Test the Final Setup**
*   Speak into your physical microphone.
*   You should see the volume meter move in the "HARDWARE INPUT 1" column in VoiceMeeter.
*   You should also see the meter move in the "VIRTUAL OUTPUT (B)" column.
*   The application you configured should now be receiving your voice correctly.
