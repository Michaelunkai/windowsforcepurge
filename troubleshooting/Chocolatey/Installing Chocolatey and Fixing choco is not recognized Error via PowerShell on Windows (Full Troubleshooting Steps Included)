This guide will help you set up **Chocolatey**‚Äîthe popular Windows package manager‚Äîusing **PowerShell**, while also solving common errors like:

```
'choco' is not recognized as an internal or external command.
```

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 1: Checking if Chocolatey is Installed**

First, launch **PowerShell as Administrator**, and verify if Chocolatey is already installed by running:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin'
```

- If you see files including `choco.exe`, go directly to **Step 4**.
- If you see an error or empty folder, proceed to **Step 2**.

## üóëÔ∏è **Step 2: Removing an Old or Corrupted Chocolatey Installation**

If Chocolatey appears to be corrupted, incomplete, or missing important files, clean it out with:

```powershell
Remove-Item 'C:\ProgramData\chocolatey' -Recurse -Force
```

---

## üì• **Step 3: Installing Chocolatey Freshly**

Run this official script to install Chocolatey (**still as Administrator**):

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; `
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = `
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; `
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

After installation completes, **close and reopen** PowerShell to refresh your environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Step 4: Fixing `'choco' is not recognized` Error**

If the `choco` command still isn't recognized, your PATH variable isn't properly set. Fix it by:

- **Temporary fix** (current session only):

```powershell
$env:Path += ';C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin'
```

- **Permanent fix** (recommended):

```powershell
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "Path",
    [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "Machine") + ";C:\ProgramData\chocolatey\bin",
    [EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine
)
```

After applying the permanent solution, **close and reopen PowerShell**.

---

## ‚úÖ **Step 5: Verify Chocolatey Installation**

Confirm that Chocolatey is successfully installed by checking its version:

```powershell
choco --version
```

You should see a version number like:

```
2.8.1
```

If you see the version number, Chocolatey is working perfectly.
