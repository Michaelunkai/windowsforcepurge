If you’re trying to install **Docker Desktop 4.40.0** on **Windows 11** and hit the error:  
> *“Docker Desktop requires the Server service to be enabled.”*

This guide will walk you step-by-step on how to **enable the required “Server” service** (also known as `LanmanServer`) using both **GUI** and **PowerShell**, so that Docker Desktop installs without problems.

### 🔧 Method 1: Enable Server Service Using Windows GUI (services.msc)

1. **Open Services Panel**  
   Press `Win + R`, type `services.msc`, and hit **Enter**.

2. **Locate the "Server" Service**  
   In the list of services, scroll down until you find:  
   **📄 Server** (also known as **LanmanServer** internally).

3. **Open and Configure**  
   - Double-click the **Server** entry.
   - Set **Startup type** to: `Automatic`.
   - Click the **Start** button under *Service status*.
   - Click **Apply**, then **OK**.

4. ✅ **Done!** Now re-run the Docker Desktop 4.40.0 installer.

### ⚙️ Method 2: Enable Server Service Using PowerShell (Recommended for Advanced Users)

1. **Launch PowerShell as Admin**  
   - Right-click Start Menu  
   - Click **Windows Terminal (Admin)** or **PowerShell (Admin)**

2. **Run the Following Commands**:
```powershell
Set-Service -Name LanmanServer -StartupType Automatic
Start-Service -Name LanmanServer
```

This will:
- Automatically configure the **Server** service to start with Windows
- Immediately launch the service

3. ✅ **Success!** Run the Docker Desktop setup again and it should complete without errors.

### 💡 Why This Happens

Docker Desktop on Windows needs the **Server** service to:
- Handle file sharing
- Support container networking
- Enable Windows features required for volume mounts

This service is sometimes disabled in stripped-down systems or due to privacy tools.
