Next Steps:
Check Papertrail Dashboard: Log in to your Papertrail account and navigate to your log viewer to ensure the logs are being received correctly.

Search for the Test Log: Look for the test log entry Test log entry from <hostname> to Papertrail that was generated by the logger command.

Verify Log Forwarding:

Make sure other system logs from your Ubuntu server (e.g., /var/log/syslog) are also being forwarded to Papertrail.
Monitoring and Alerts:

Set up search filters, alerts, and notifications in Papertrail if needed, to monitor specific events or errors.
