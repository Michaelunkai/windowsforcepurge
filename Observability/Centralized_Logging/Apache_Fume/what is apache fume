**Apache Flume** is a distributed system designed for efficiently collecting, aggregating, and transporting large volumes of log data from multiple sources to a centralized data store, such as Hadoop HDFS. It is primarily used for log data analysis in real-time or batch processing, offering fault tolerance, scalability, and reliability. Flume allows defining various data sources, channels for buffering, and sinks where the data is stored, creating customizable and scalable data ingestion pipelines for big data environments.
