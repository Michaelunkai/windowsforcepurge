Key Features:

Metrics-based monitoring.
Libraries and server components for metric exposure, collection, and utilization.
Written in Go and under open governance.

Step 2: System Architecture Overview

Prometheus Server:
Central component.
Pull-based monitoring system.
Pulls metrics via HTTP from monitored targets.

Targets:

Monitored endpoints.
Can be services, applications, or third-party systems.
Exporter processes enable non-Prometheus metrics exposure.

Configuration:

Static or dynamic target definition.
Supports various service discovery mechanisms.

Step 3: Core Features of Prometheus

Dimensional Data Model:
Tracks time-series data.
Identifiers: Metric name and labels.

Metrics Transfer Format:

Text-based format over HTTP.
Example: HTTP request counter, open file descriptors.

Query Language (PromQL):

Allows querying and processing collected data.
Enables alerting, dashboarding, and ad hoc debugging.

Integrated Alerting:

Utilizes PromQL for defining alerting rules.
Alert manager dispatches alerts.

Service Discovery:

Automatically discovers and updates targets.
Supports DNS, Kubernetes, Consul, etc.

Step 4: Example PromQL Queries

Query Examples:

Retrieve current values for specific time series.
Calculate rates, aggregate data, and filter results.

Alerting Rules:

Define rules using PromQL expressions.
Configure alert metadata.

Step 5: Conclusion and Further Learning

Service Discovery Integration:
Essential for dynamic environments.
Supports various mechanisms.
