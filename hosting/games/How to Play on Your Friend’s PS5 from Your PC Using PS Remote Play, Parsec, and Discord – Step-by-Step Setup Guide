1. **Turn on the PS5** and go to **Settings**.  
2. Navigate to **System > Remote Play** and toggle **Enable Remote Play** to ON.  
3. Then, go to **Settings > System > Power Saving > Features Available in Rest Mode** and enable:

### **🔹 Step 2: Download and Install the PS Remote Play App on Your PC**  
To stream the PS5 to your PC, you need **PS Remote Play** software.

2. Download the **Windows or macOS** version.  
3. Install and launch **PS Remote Play**.

### **🔹 Step 3: Connect to Your Friend’s PS5 from Your PC**  
Your friend must **share their PlayStation account** with you to log in remotely.  

1. **Open PS Remote Play** and sign in using your friend’s PlayStation account.  
2. Select **PS5** as the device to connect.  
3. If the PS5 is in Rest Mode, it should automatically wake up and allow you to play.  

⚠️ **Security Warning**: Sharing account credentials can be risky. Ensure you trust your friend before proceeding.

### **🔹 Step 4: Use a Compatible Controller for Remote Play**  
For the best experience, use a **PlayStation controller**:  
- **DualSense (PS5 controller) via USB or Bluetooth**

Third-party controllers **may** work, but keyboard and mouse support is very limited.

## **Method 2: Using Parsec for Low-Latency Remote PS5 Gaming**  

### **🔹 Step 1: Install Parsec on Both Computers**  
If PS Remote Play is too laggy, **Parsec** is a great alternative for smoother gameplay.  

1. **Download Parsec** from:  
   👉 [https://parsec.app/](https://parsec.app/)  
2. Install **Parsec** on both your PC and your friend’s PC.

### **🔹 Step 2: Your Friend Hosts the PS5 Stream**  
Your friend needs to:  
1. Open **Parsec** and create an account.  
2. Share their **Parsec Friend Code** with you.  
3. **Stream their PC** (which has PS Remote Play running) using Parsec.

### **🔹 Step 3: Connect and Play from Your PC**  
1. Open **Parsec** and enter your friend’s **Friend Code** to join.  
2. Once connected, you’ll be able to **control the PS5** as if you were there.  

🎮 **Bonus**: Parsec allows **keyboard and mouse support** if your friend enables it.

## **Method 3: Using Discord Screen Share (Basic Solution for Watching or Turn-Based Games)**  

### **🔹 Step 1: Your Friend Shares Their Screen on Discord**  
1. Open **Discord** and join a voice call.  
2. Your friend clicks **Share Your Screen**.  
3. Select the **PS Remote Play window** and start streaming.  

---

### **🔹 Step 2: Play or Watch**  
- This method **only works well for slow-paced games** (turn-based or single-player).  
- It **does not allow direct control** unless your friend also gives you control via software like Parsec.

## **Conclusion**  
### **Best Method for Different Situations**  
| Method | Best For | Control? | Latency |
|--------|---------|----------|---------|
| **PS Remote Play** | Direct, official connection | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ May lag |
| **Parsec** | Best for low-latency gaming | ✅ Yes | ✅ Low lag |
