### Detailed Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up and Running the JSON Resume CLI Project in Ubuntu

#### 1. **Install Node.js and npm**
   Ensure that Node.js and npm are installed on your system. If they are not installed, you can install them with the following commands:

     
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y nodejs npm

#### 2. **Clone the Repository**
   Clone the `resume-cli` repository to your local machine using Git:

     
   git clone https://github.com/jsonresume/resume-cli.git
   cd resume-cli

#### 3. **Install the Required npm Packages**
   Install the necessary npm packages for the project:

     
   npm install

#### 4. **Install the Resume CLI Globally**
   Install the Resume CLI globally so you can use the `resume` command anywhere on your system:

     
   sudo npm install -g resume-cli

#### 5. **Initialize a New Resume**
   To create a new resume file in JSON format, run the following command:

     
   resume init

   This will create a `resume.json` file in the current directory.

#### 6. **Edit the `resume.json` File**
   Open the `resume.json` file in your preferred text editor and fill it with your resume details. Be sure to follow the JSON Resume schema. You can refer to the schema documentation [here](https://jsonresume.org/schema/).

   Example:

     
   nano resume.json

#### 7. **Validate the Resume**
   To ensure your resume follows the JSON Resume schema, validate it with:

     
   resume validate

#### 8. **Export the Resume to HTML or PDF**
   Export your resume to an HTML or PDF format using the following command:

     
   resume export resume.html --format html --theme even

   You can change the `--format` to `pdf` to export it as a PDF.

#### 9. **Serve the Resume Locally**
   To serve your resume on a local web server and view it in the browser, run:

     
   resume serve

   By default, the resume will be served at `http://localhost:4000/`.

   You can specify a custom port if needed:

     
   resume serve --port 8080

#### 10. **Developing Themes**
   If you want to develop or customize themes, navigate to the theme directory and use the following command to serve the resume with your custom theme:

     
   resume serve --theme .

That's it! You have now set up and run the JSON Resume CLI project in Ubuntu.
