 I haven't seen a discussion about this here, but Twitter is abuzz with a new model claiming to be the best in the world – the Reflection 70B. The story began when the CEO of a small startup called HyperWrite announced a few days ago the release of the strongest model in the world. He claimed that the model is based on Llama 3.1 70B, which underwent special training, and he published a table showing Reflection 70B outperforming most models in various benchmarks. He even added that they are now training a version of Llama 405B in the same way.

His main idea, which has appeared in various versions in past articles, is to separate the model's thinking and response processes through the recursive feeding of the model’s own output into its training. HyperWrite even published the model and its weights on Hugging Face (HF) and received significant attention from the community.

However, it wasn't long before experts in models and private companies attempting to replicate the results encountered significantly poor performance. Analyses showed that the weights of Reflection 70B disturbingly resembled those of Llama 3.0 70B. In response, the CEO claimed there was a technical issue in uploading the weights and promised to upload the correct weights as soon as possible.

Later, he claimed that the correct weights had been uploaded, but the results were still inexplicably different. As a result, he opened an API to the public, and the outcomes received were quite good – similar to those of closed models, which was impressive for the 70B model. But then, people tinkered with the model and revealed through various tests, such as questions about the model’s identity and insights into the tokenizer, that it was actually making calls to Claude. After this was exposed, the calls were initially switched to OpenAI and subsequently to Llama 3.1 405B.

After all these events, the CEO claimed he did not understand what went wrong and that they were still training the new model. However, he disappeared from Twitter, and his situation does not look good.
