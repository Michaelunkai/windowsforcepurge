### Comprehensive Step-by-Step Tutorial on Setting Up and Running the Botpress Project on Ubuntu with Git, Node.js, and pnpm for Developing Next-Generation Chatbots

This detailed guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running the Botpress project on an Ubuntu system. The tutorial covers installing necessary tools like Git, Node.js, and pnpm, cloning the Botpress repository, and running the project locally. This setup will allow you to develop and deploy powerful chatbots using the Botpress platform.

#### Step 1: Install Prerequisites (Git, Node.js, pnpm)
Before setting up the Botpress project, ensure that the necessary tools are installed on your Ubuntu system:

1. **Update Package List and Install Git and curl:**

      
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y git curl

2. **Install Node.js (Includes npm):**

    Add the Node.js repository and install Node.js:

      
    curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo apt install -y nodejs

3. **Install pnpm (Fast and Efficient Package Manager):**

    Install pnpm globally using npm:

      
    npm install -g pnpm

#### Step 2: Clone the Botpress Repository
Next, clone the Botpress repository from GitHub to your local machine:

1. **Navigate to Your Desired Directory:**

      
    cd ~

2. **Remove Any Existing botpress Directory:**

    If you previously cloned the repository but encountered issues, remove the existing directory:

      
    rm -rf botpress

3. **Clone the Botpress Repository:**

      
    git clone https://github.com/botpress/botpress.git

4. **Navigate to the Botpress Directory:**

      
    cd botpress

#### Step 3: Verify the Presence of `package.json`
Ensure that the `package.json` file is present in the root directory of the cloned repository. This file is crucial for installing dependencies.

1. **List Files in the Directory:**

      
    ls

    You should see `package.json` among the listed files.

#### Step 4: Install Project Dependencies
With the `package.json` file in place, proceed to install all the necessary dependencies using pnpm:

1. **Install Dependencies:**

      
    pnpm install

#### Step 5: Build the Project
After installing dependencies, build the Botpress project to prepare it for running:

1. **Build All Packages:**

      
    pnpm run build

#### Step 6: Run the Project Locally
Once the project is built, you can run it locally:

1. **Start the Botpress Project:**

      
    pnpm start

#### Step 7: Access the Botpress Application
After starting the project, access the Botpress application through your web browser:

1. **Open Your Web Browser:**

    Navigate to the following URL:

    http://localhost:3000

#### Conclusion
By following this comprehensive tutorial, youâ€™ve successfully set up and run the Botpress project on Ubuntu using Git, Node.js, and pnpm. This environment will allow you to develop advanced chatbots with the Botpress platform, harnessing the power of modern AI and integration tools. Happy coding! ðŸš€
