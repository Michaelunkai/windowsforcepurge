# Unveiling SearchGPT: An Exclusive Preview of the OpenAI Search Engine
## When Search Gets a Revolutionary Twist
### Introduction
Imagine asking your search engine any question that comes to mind and receiving not only quick answers but also images, and links—all in real-time. Meet SearchGPT, OpenAI's search engine. As one of the few granted early access, I am excited to share everything you need to know about SearchGPT, how it compares to Perplexity, its strengths and weaknesses, and how you can leverage this advanced technology to enhance your search experience.
### Unveiling the Power of SearchGPT
In July, OpenAI launched SearchGPT in a beta version exclusively available to select Pro users. This search engine integrates OpenAI's advanced language models with real-time internet information, offering live searches, follow-up questions, source links, related images, and more.
#### Privacy and User Control
A crucial aspect of using SearchGPT involves privacy. The tool’s terms of use indicate that it may train on your search history, access your location, and potentially share information with third parties. However, these settings can be easily modified in the search engine’s settings, allowing you to maintain control over your data.
### Accessing SearchGPT
There are two main ways to access SearchGPT:
1. **Through ChatGPT**: Within the ChatGPT interface, you can find the search button on the left sidebar.
2. **Via Chrome Extension**: Installing the SearchGPT extension in Chrome provides direct access to all its features.
### User Experience: Simple and Intuitive
The user interface of SearchGPT is designed to be simple and user-friendly. Search results are displayed alongside links to sources and related images. The left sidebar features buttons for new searches, viewing links, and images, enhancing the user experience. The layout is clean and uncluttered, presenting answers first and sources afterward, similar to the minimalist design of Perplexity but with its unique differences.
### Exploring SearchGPT's Capabilities
SearchGPT offers real-time searches, links, images, articles, and even YouTube videos. It supports follow-up questions within the same search window, enhancing its utility for ongoing research. However, it currently cannot search social media platforms directly, instead relying on sources like blogs and news sites. OpenAI’s collaboration with Reddit allows SearchGPT to include discussion threads from the platform, adding valuable context to its responses. Additionally, SearchGPT can access the user's location for performing searches nearby, a feature that is optional and can be enabled or disabled based on preference.
### Real-Time Search in Action
Testing SearchGPT's real-time search capabilities revealed impressive performance. For example, when asked for the current stock price of Microsoft, it provided a graph of the stock’s metrics and reflected the closing price as the market was not open at the time. In another test, converting 100 Euros to Dollars, SearchGPT delivered an incorrect answer without any supporting sources, whereas Perplexity provided the correct answer with reliable references.
### Comparing SearchGPT and Perplexity
Perplexity, an AI-based search engine, offers focused and broad searches, including articles, videos, and more. Unlike SearchGPT, Perplexity allows file uploads for search purposes and supports targeted searches. Despite these differences, SearchGPT excels in delivering organized and user-friendly information. OpenAI aims to close the gap between Pro and free users since the launch of GPT-4o, offering features like image creation, personal chatbots, code generation, file uploads, voice agents, and chat.
### Leveraging SearchGPT for Business
Businesses can greatly benefit from integrating SearchGPT into their workflows. Its real-time search capabilities allow for quick gathering of the latest information on market trends, competitor analysis, and industry news. Receiving relevant images, articles, and videos in response to queries can enhance marketing strategies and content creation. Follow-up questions within the same search window ensure thorough and efficient research. However, businesses should always verify the information obtained to ensure accuracy and reliability, as even advanced AI tools can sometimes hallucinate.
### Conclusion
Both SearchGPT and Perplexity bring unique strengths to AI-driven search technology. While Perplexity offers broader search capabilities, SearchGPT provides an integrated, user-friendly experience with a robust set of features. SearchGPT is a valuable addition for paid users. Stay tuned as we continue to explore and compare the latest advancements in AI technology.
