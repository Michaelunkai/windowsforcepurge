Step 1: Describe What You Want
Type a plain-English request:

“Create a Python script that renames all files in a folder to include today’s date.”

Codex (via GPT-4) will return working Python code like:

python
Copy code
import os
from datetime import datetime

folder = "./my_files"
date_str = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

for filename in os.listdir(folder):
    old_path = os.path.join(folder, filename)
    if os.path.isfile(old_path):
        new_name = f"{date_str}_{filename}"
        new_path = os.path.join(folder, new_name)
        os.rename(old_path, new_path)

print("Files renamed.")
Step 2: Ask for Edits
You can follow up:

“Add error handling and log renamed files to a text file.”

Codex adapts the code and improves it accordingly.
