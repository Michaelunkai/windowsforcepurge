## Comprehensive Guide: Setting Up and Running vLLM on Ubuntu Using Python, Virtualenv, and EleutherAI's GPT Models

### Step-by-Step Instructions for Installing and Executing vLLM with a Smaller Model to Avoid Memory Issues

1. **Update Your System:**
   Ensure your system is up to date.
     
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

2. **Install Python and pip:**
   vLLM requires Python 3.7 or newer. If you don't have Python installed, you can install it using:
     
   sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip -y

3. **Install Virtualenv:**
   It's good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies.
     
   sudo pip3 install virtualenv

4. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
     
   mkdir ~/vllm_project
   cd ~/vllm_project
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate

5. **Install vLLM:**
   Install vLLM using pip.
     
   pip install vllm

6. **Setting Up a Simple vLLM Script:**
   Create a Python script to test vLLM. Create a file named `test_vllm.py` and open it with a text editor.
     
   nano test_vllm.py

   Add the following content to `test_vllm.py`:
     
   from vllm import LLM, SamplingParams

   # Initialize the LLM model with a smaller model and set the device to CPU
   llm = LLM(model='EleutherAI/gpt-neo-1.3B', device="cpu")

   # Define the prompt and sampling parameters
   prompt = "The capital of France is"
   sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9, max_tokens=50)

   # Generate the response
   outputs = llm.generate(prompt, sampling_params)

   # Print the generated text
   for output in outputs:
       print(output.text)

7. **Run the Script:**
   Make sure you are still in the virtual environment and run the script.
     
     test_vllm.py

8. **Deactivating the Virtual Environment:**
   After running your script, you can deactivate the virtual environment by:
     
   deactivate

9. **Install Additional Dependencies (if needed):**
   If your project requires additional dependencies, you can install them using pip. For example:
     
   pip install numpy pandas

10. **Keeping Your Environment Clean:**
    Remember to activate the virtual environment whenever you work on your vLLM project:
      
    source ~/vllm_project/venv/bin/activate

By following these steps, you should be able to set up and run vLLM on your Ubuntu system using a supported model without encountering memory issues. If you have any further questions or need additional customization, feel free to ask!
