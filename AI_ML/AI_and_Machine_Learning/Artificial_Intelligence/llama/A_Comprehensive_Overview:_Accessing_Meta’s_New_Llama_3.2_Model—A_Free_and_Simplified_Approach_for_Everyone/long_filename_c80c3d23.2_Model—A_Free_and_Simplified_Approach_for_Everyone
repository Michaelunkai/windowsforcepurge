2. **Privacy**: Since the model operates locally, privacy is significantly improved. No need to worry about third-party servers handling your data.

3. **Multilingual Support**: In my tests, Llama 3.2 performed decently in Hebrew, which is a pleasant surprise for non-English users.

4. **Comparative Performance**: However, despite these advantages, GPT and Claude remain far superior in terms of overall performance and response quality.

### Final Verdict:

- If you're looking for a **flexible and fast model** to run on your personal devices, Llama 3.2 is a fantastic option.

- On the other hand, if you want the **best results**, it's still wise to stick with models like **ChatGPT** and **Claude**. Don't let FOMO drive your decisions—there’s nothing groundbreaking here.
