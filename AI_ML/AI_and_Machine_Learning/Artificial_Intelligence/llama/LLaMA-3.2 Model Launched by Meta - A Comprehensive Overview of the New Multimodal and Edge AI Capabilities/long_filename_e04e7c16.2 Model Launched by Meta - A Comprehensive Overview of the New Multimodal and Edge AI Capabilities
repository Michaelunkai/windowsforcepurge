**Key Details:**

- **Model Versions and Sizes:** The LLaMA-3.2 model comes in multiple sizes to cater to a range of applications. The multimodal models are available in sizes of **11B** and **90B**, optimized for complex vision and language tasks, while the smaller models designed for edge devices are available in **3B** and **1B**, ensuring compatibility with mobile and low-power environments.

- **Vision Performance:** The multimodal versions of LLaMA-3.2 demonstrate unprecedented vision processing capabilities. The smaller **11B model** has outperformed its competitors, surpassing the vision-based performance of both **Claude-3** and the smaller versions of **GPT-4**. This positions it as the top model for vision-related tasks.

- **Text Performance:** For text-based applications, the larger **90B parameter model** exhibits performance that rivals **Claude-3** and the smaller versions of **GPT-4**. Early test results indicate that LLaMA-3.2 delivers highly competitive accuracy in text understanding and generation tasks.

- **Updates and Performance Tables:** Further details on LLaMA-3.2's performance are still being reviewed. Updated performance metrics will be provided as they become available.

**Context and Commentary:**

In the past two weeks, several development teams have reached a level of training infrastructure and data management that allows them to "simply wait" for increasingly powerful models to emerge over time. This accelerated model development process has led to the rapid release of powerful models such as **Deepseek-2.5**, **Qwen-2.5**, and now **LLaMA-3.2**, all within a short timeframe. The high-efficiency infrastructure supporting these models enables fast iteration and frequent model updates, setting a new standard for the industry.
