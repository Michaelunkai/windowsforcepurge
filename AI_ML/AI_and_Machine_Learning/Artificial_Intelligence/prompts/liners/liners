for every tool you mentioned, make a line that looks like this : "create one liner, to setup and run <the tools name> in ubuntu, and use it in the end!"
also explain what is each tool in 5 words!
and also - above every liner... add this line(not as part of the code): cd .. && mkc <tool name> && echo command to paste the one liner to file named 'one liner to setup and run <tool name> in ubuntu'
