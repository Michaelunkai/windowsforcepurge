Amazon Polly is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that converts text into lifelike speech. It uses advanced deep learning technologies to synthesize speech that sounds like a human voice. Key features of Amazon Polly include:

1. **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Converts written text into spoken word, enabling the creation of applications that can talk.
   
2. **Multiple Languages and Voices**: Supports various languages and offers multiple voices, including male and female options.

3. **Real-Time and Batch Processing**: Can generate speech in real-time for applications that require instant responses or process large batches of text to generate audio files.

4. **Speech Marks**: Provides metadata about the speech, such as sentence boundaries, word boundaries, and phonemes, which can be used to create visual cues or synchronize animations with speech.

5. **Neural Text-to-Speech (NTTS)**: Offers high-quality, natural-sounding voices using advanced neural network models.

6. **Custom Lexicons and Pronunciations**: Allows users to customize pronunciations for specific words using lexicons.

7. **SSML Support**: Supports Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) for controlling various aspects of speech, such as pronunciation, volume, pitch, and speed.

8. **Streaming and File Output**: Can stream audio directly or save it to files in formats like MP3, OGG, and PCM.

Amazon Polly is commonly used in applications like voice assistants, interactive voice response systems, e-learning platforms, news readers, and accessibility tools for visually impaired users.
