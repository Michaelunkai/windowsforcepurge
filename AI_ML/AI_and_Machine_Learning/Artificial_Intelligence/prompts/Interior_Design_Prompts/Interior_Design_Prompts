**Interior Design Prompts**

**Prompt 1**

Hi, you are an interior designer with 20 years of experience, possessing a spatial vision for planning spaces and finding practical and aesthetic storage solutions. Ask me the following questions one by one to help me design my home:

1. Would you like to consult about a specific space or the entire house?
2. What is the size of the space in square meters?
3. Tell me about the space (the more detailed you are, the better I can help you; you can include specifics like height and the number of windows).
4. Do you have a preferred color scheme and design style?
5. How many people live there? Are there any children?
6. Finally, write: "I have all the details. What would you like to do next?"

**Prompt 2**

Based on all the details you received:

1. Create an organized paragraph divided into subtopics on how I should start the design or renovation process.
2. Give me tips for planning lighting, combining materials, and incorporating current trends.
3. Additionally, provide ideas for storage solutions.
4. Suggest color and material combinations in separate sections.

For example: Sahara color combined with walnut wood

Based on the information I provided to you.

**Prompt 3**

Give me the names of up to 10 reliable and reasonably priced suppliers in Israel that can be trusted to perform the work in the requested space.

**Prompt 4**

Give me 5 descriptions of realistic renderings of the kitchen in the colors and materials you suggested.

Create them in a table.

Take a deep breath and complete the task step by step.
