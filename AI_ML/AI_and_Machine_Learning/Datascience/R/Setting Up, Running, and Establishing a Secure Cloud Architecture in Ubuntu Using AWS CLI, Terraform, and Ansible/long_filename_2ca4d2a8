### Comprehensive Guide: Setting Up, Running, and Establishing a Secure Cloud Architecture in Ubuntu Using AWS CLI, Terraform, and Ansible

#### **Step 1: Installing Essential Cloud Management Tools**
Begin by installing the essential tools required to manage and secure your cloud infrastructure. You'll need to install `AWS CLI`, `Terraform`, and `Ansible`.

  
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y awscli terraform ansible

#### **Step 2: Configuring AWS CLI for Cloud Resource Management**
Configure the AWS CLI with your credentials to manage AWS resources securely.

  
aws configure
Follow the prompts to input your `AWS Access Key ID`, `AWS Secret Access Key`, `Default region name`, and `Default output format`.

#### **Step 3: Setting Up Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform**
Create a directory to store your Terraform files, which will define your cloud infrastructure.

  
mkdir -p ~/cloud_secure_architecture/terraform && cd ~/cloud_secure_architecture/terraform

Create a `main.tf` file to define your secure Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) setup.

  
nano main.tf

Example `main.tf` for a secure VPC configuration:

 hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_support = true
  enable_dns_hostnames = true
  tags = {
    Name = "secure-vpc"
  }
}

resource "aws_subnet" "public_subnet" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  tags = {
    Name = "public-subnet"
  }
}

Initialize and apply the Terraform configuration to provision the infrastructure:

  
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

#### **Step 4: Securing Cloud Infrastructure with AWS Security Groups**
Add security groups to your Terraform configuration to control inbound and outbound traffic, enhancing the security of your cloud environment.

Add the following to your `main.tf`:

 hcl
resource "aws_security_group" "web_sg" {
  vpc_id = aws_vpc.main.id
  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  tags = {
    Name = "web-sg"
  }
}

Apply the updated Terraform configuration to implement the security group:

  
terraform apply -auto-approve

#### **Step 5: Automating Security Configurations with Ansible**
Leverage Ansible to automate the configuration and management of your secure cloud environment.

Create a directory for your Ansible playbook:

  
mkdir -p ~/cloud_secure_architecture/ansible && cd ~/cloud_secure_architecture/ansible
nano secure-cloud.yml

Example `secure-cloud.yml` playbook for basic security configurations:

  
---
- hosts: localhost
  tasks:
    - name: Update and upgrade apt packages
      apt:
        update_cache: yes
        upgrade: dist

    - name: Install necessary security packages
      apt:
        name:
          - ufw
          - fail2ban
        state: present

    - name: Configure UFW to allow SSH and HTTP
      ufw:
        rule: allow
        name: "OpenSSH"
      notify: reload ufw

    - name: Enable UFW
      ufw:
        state: enabled

  handlers:
    - name: reload ufw
      command: ufw reload

Run the Ansible playbook to apply security configurations:

  
ansible-playbook secure-cloud.yml

#### **Step 6: Establishing Monitoring and Logging with AWS CloudWatch**
Set up AWS CloudWatch to monitor and log your cloud environment activities.

In your Terraform configuration (`main.tf`), add the following resources:

 hcl
resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_group" "secure_log_group" {
  name = "secure-log-group"
  retention_in_days = 7
}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_log_stream" "secure_log_stream" {
  name           = "secure-log-stream"
  log_group_name = aws_cloudwatch_log_group.secure_log_group.name
}

Apply the updated Terraform configuration to set up logging:

  
terraform apply -auto-approve

#### **Step 7: Implementing Identity and Access Management (IAM)**
Ensure secure access to cloud resources by creating IAM roles and policies.

Add IAM configuration to your `main.tf` file:

 hcl
resource "aws_iam_role" "ec2_role" {
  name = "ec2-role"
  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = "sts:AssumeRole"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Principal = {
          Service = "ec2.amazonaws.com"
        }
      }
    ]
  })
}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy" "ec2_policy" {
  name = "ec2-policy"
  role = aws_iam_role.ec2_role.id
  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Action = [
          "s3:ListBucket",
          "s3:GetObject"
        ]
        Effect = "Allow"
        Resource = "*"
      }
    ]
  })
}

Apply the IAM roles and policies to enforce secure access:

  
terraform apply -auto-approve

#### **Step 8: Continuous Monitoring and Auditing with AWS Config**
Implement AWS Config for continuous monitoring and auditing of your cloud environment.

Add AWS Config resources to your `main.tf` file:

 hcl
resource "aws_config_configuration_recorder" "main" {
  name     = "config-recorder"
  role_arn = aws_iam_role.ec2_role.arn
  recording_group {
    all_supported = true
  }
}

resource "aws_config_delivery_channel" "main" {
  name           = "config-delivery"
  s3_bucket_name = "your-config-bucket"
}

Apply the configuration to enable continuous monitoring:

  
terraform apply -auto-approve

#### **Step 9: Conducting Regular Security Audits with AWS Inspector**
Schedule regular security audits using AWS Inspector to identify vulnerabilities.

In your Terraform configuration (`main.tf`), add the following:

 hcl
resource "aws_inspector_assessment_template" "main" {
  name       = "assessment-template"
  duration   = 3600
  rules_package_arns = [
    "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:rulespackage/0-ABcdefgh",
    "arn:aws:inspector:us-west-2:123456789012:rulespackage/0-hijklmno",
  ]
}

Apply the security assessment configuration:

  
terraform apply -auto-approve

#### **Step 10: Enforcing Security Best Practices**
- Regularly update and patch your servers using Ansible playbooks.
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all IAM users.
- Enable encryption for all data at rest and in transit.
- Conduct regular security training and awareness for your team.

With these steps, you've established a secure cloud architecture in Ubuntu, using AWS CLI, Terraform, and Ansible, ensuring your infrastructure is robust, compliant, and monitored effectively.
