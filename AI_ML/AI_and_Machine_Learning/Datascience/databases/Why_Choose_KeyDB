Why Choose KeyDB?
If you are already using Redis but are encountering performance bottlenecks due to its single-threaded nature, KeyDB might be a good alternative. It offers the same familiar features and commands as Redis, making migration relatively straightforward, but with the added benefit of multi-threaded performance and advanced replication capabilities.

In summary, KeyDB can be seen as an optimized version of Redis, tailored for environments that demand higher throughput and the ability to utilize modern multi-core processors effectively.
