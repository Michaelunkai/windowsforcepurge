**Complete Step-by-Step Tutorial for Setting Up and Running the Meltano ELT Tool on Ubuntu with Python Virtual Environment, Git, Tap-Gitlab, and Target-JSONL for Data Pipelines**

### 1. Update System and Install Dependencies
Ensure that your system is up to date and that you have all the necessary tools like **Python3**, **Pip**, and **Git** installed:
  
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv git

### 2. Clone the Meltano Repository Using Git
Clone the official Meltano repository from GitHub to get the latest version of the tool:
  
git clone https://github.com/meltano/meltano.git

### 3. Navigate to the Meltano Directory
Change directory to the folder that you just cloned:
  
cd meltano

### 4. Create a Python Virtual Environment for Meltano
Set up a Python virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:
  
python3 -m venv .venv

### 5. Activate the Python Virtual Environment
Activate the environment to use the correct Python and installed libraries for Meltano:
  
source .venv/bin/activate

### 6. Install Meltano and Its Python Dependencies Using Pip
Install Meltano from the local cloned repository into the virtual environment:
  
pip install -e .

### 7. Initialize a New Meltano Project
Now that Meltano is installed, initialize a new project. Replace `my_project` with your desired project name:
  
meltano init my_project

### 8. Navigate to the New Meltano Project Directory
Switch to the newly created project directory to begin configuring and working with Meltano:
  
cd my_project

### 9. Add an Extractor and Loader (Tap-Gitlab and Target-JSONL) to the Project
Meltano works with extractors and loaders to create ELT pipelines. Here, we'll add **tap-gitlab** (extractor) and **target-jsonl** (loader) to your project:
  
meltano add extractor tap-gitlab
meltano add loader target-jsonl

### 10. Configure the Extractor with Your GitLab Token and Project
Set the required configuration for **tap-gitlab**. You need to provide your GitLab access token and specify the project from which data will be extracted:
  
meltano config tap-gitlab set private_token YOUR_GITLAB_TOKEN
meltano config tap-gitlab set project YOUR_GITLAB_PROJECT
Replace `YOUR_GITLAB_TOKEN` and `YOUR_GITLAB_PROJECT` with your actual credentials.

### 11. Install Meltano Project Dependencies
Now, install any remaining dependencies required by the Meltano project:
  
meltano install

### 12. Run the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) Pipeline
Run the Meltano ELT pipeline to extract data from GitLab using **tap-gitlab** and load it into JSONL format using **target-jsonl**:
  
meltano elt tap-gitlab target-jsonl

### 13. Explore Available Plugins Using Meltano Hub
To explore more plugins (extractors, loaders, transformers, etc.), you can interact with **Meltano Hub**:
  
meltano hub

### 14. Access Meltano Documentation for Advanced Configurations
If you need help or want to dive deeper into more advanced setups, open the Meltano documentation in your browser:

Now you've successfully set up and run **Meltano** with **Python virtual environment**, **Git**, **tap-gitlab**, and **target-jsonl** on **Ubuntu**! Use this guide as a reference whenever you need to initialize new projects or configure your extractors/loaders in the future.
