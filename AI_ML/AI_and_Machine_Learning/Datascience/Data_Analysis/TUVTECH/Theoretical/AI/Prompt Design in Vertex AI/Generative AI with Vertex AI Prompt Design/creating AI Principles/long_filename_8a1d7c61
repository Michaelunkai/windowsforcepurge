A core part of AI governance is a robust issue spotting practice.
00:05
Issue spotting is the process of recognizing the potential for ethical concerns in an AI project.
00:11
The AI principles your organization develops can be a guide for spotting these issues.
00:16
To address ethical concerns, we first need to identify them.
00:21
It may be tempting to try and make this process more efficient through checklists, outlining what is and isn’t acceptable for each principle.
00:30
We know it’s tempting because we tried it.
00:32
We tried to create decision trees and checklists that would ensure our technology would be ethical.
00:38
That didn’t work.
00:40
The reality is that we need to address ethical issues, not just in familiar products or use
00:45
cases, but also by recognizing new risks that we have never seen before emerging from new technologies.
00:53
Each use case, customer, and social context is unique.
00:57
A tool or solution aligned with our AI principles in one context could be misaligned in another.
01:05
Technologies we’ve never imagined are being developed at rapid speed and scale that require an adaptive process, not rigid, prescriptive yes or no answers.
01:14
It's not feasible to expect to create a simple checklist for each use case to meet your AI principles.
01:19
We’ve learned that there’s no replacement for careful review of the facts of each case.
01:25
A useful analogy is to think of ethical issues like birds.
01:29
They are all around us, often unseen, they tend to be found in some areas more than others, and they range from big to small, exotic to ordinary.
01:39
Noticing them gets easier with practice— on your way to work, you probably passed a lot of birds but you probably didn’t really notice them.
01:47
Now imagine you were a trained birdwatcher.
01:49
You’d be more sensitized to the species you encounter along your route and much more likely to notice the intricate differences in birds you pass everyday.
01:58
Similarly, in issue spotting, the goal is to become more sensitized, to be able to quickly and accurately identify and classify ethical issues and risks.
02:09
As with birdwatching, you see more as a team, so having multiple reviewers helps.
02:14
No one individual can see everything that’s there and there exist special tools that enhance spotting abilities.
02:22
In the case of ethical issue spotting, moral philosophers have spent thousands of years developing lenses to help identify ethical issues.
02:31
While you may look at the various philosophical lenses and wonder which you should choose to align
02:35
with, we have discovered that it really isn’t about choosing one approach over another for all scenarios.
02:41
In practice, leveraging ethical lenses provides a structured way of considering issues from multiple angles and perspectives to make sure we are surveying and surfacing what is important to consider.
02:54
Learning when and how to use such lenses allows you to switch between assessing the consequences of your decisions, their
02:59
impact on human rights and duties, as well as their alignment with what it means to have a virtuous character.
