## Putting Your Prompt-Engineering Skills to the Test: Vertex AI Challenge Lab (GSP519)

After learning the fundamentals of prompt design and the Gen AI SDK, it’s time to prove you can do the work without a script. **“Prompt Design in Vertex AI: Challenge Lab”** is a 90-minute, hands-on capstone that drops you into a realistic marketing scenario and asks you to build two generative-AI tools—an image-driven product-description generator and a fully-parameterised tagline engine—using Gemini inside Vertex AI. No step-by-step hints, just an automated grader that awards points when your solutions work.

### The Business Brief

*Client*: **Cymbal Direct**, an e-commerce brand launching a youth-oriented outdoor-gear line.
*Goal*: Generate marketing copy that evokes the wonder of nature.

You’ll deliver:

1. **Evocative Product Descriptions** – short, image-inspired blurbs that capture colour, texture, and vibe.
2. **Catchy Taglines** – audience-tuned slogans that highlight durability, light weight, and a spirit of adventure.

### What You Must Build

| Task                                | What You Create                                                                                                                                                                                      | Key Skills Demonstrated                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Gemini Image-Analysis Tool**   | A prompt (saved as **“Cymbal Product Analysis”**) that accepts a GCS image and returns multiple text options—plain description, ad-friendly copy, and a poetic line.                                 | Multimodal prompting, temperature tuning, result iteration |
| **2. Gemini Tagline Generator**     | A parameterised prompt (**“Cymbal Tagline Generator Template”**) with system instructions and two example shots. Lets marketers mix product traits, target audiences, and emotional tones on demand. | Few-shot learning, prompt parameters, style transfer       |
| **3. Notebook Hack—Image Analysis** | *image-analysis.ipynb* where you paste the Studio-exported Python code, shorten the output to <10 words, then dial up creativity (e.g., via temperature) for unexpected results.                     | SDK usage, parameter tweaking, iterative testing           |
| **4. Notebook Hack—Taglines**       | *tagline-generator.ipynb* where you inject the keyword **“nature”** into the last input prompt and verify the model includes it in the output.                                                       | Prompt mutation, keyword control, rapid validation         |

Finish all four, click **Check my progress**, and the scorer grants 100 %.

### How the Challenge Lab Works

1. **One-click Cloud Environment** – Start Lab → receive temp credentials.
2. **Vertex AI Studio** – Craft and save prompts in your chosen region.
3. **Workbench JupyterLab** – Export code, run SDK calls, edit, rerun.
4. **Automated Grader** – Monitors GCP resources, notebooks, and prompt names. Pass = badge progress.

*Tip*: keep Chrome in Incognito to avoid mixing your own GCP account with the temporary student project.

### Why This Matters

* **Authentic Workflow** – Mirrors how real teams jump between Studio prototyping and notebook refinement.
* **Prompt Literacy Under Pressure** – You must diagnose errors, tweak parameters, and read model behaviour without hand-holding.
* **Portfolio Piece** – The finished notebooks and saved prompts double as proof you can ship generative-AI features inside Google Cloud.

### After You Pass

* **Earn the “Prompt Design in Vertex AI” skill-badge**, completing the broader *Introduction to Generative AI* learning path.
* Explore advanced notebooks in the **Vertex AI Cookbook**—function calling, tool use, and chain-of-thought techniques.
* Reuse your tagline template for any product line by simply swapping attributes in the parameter block.
