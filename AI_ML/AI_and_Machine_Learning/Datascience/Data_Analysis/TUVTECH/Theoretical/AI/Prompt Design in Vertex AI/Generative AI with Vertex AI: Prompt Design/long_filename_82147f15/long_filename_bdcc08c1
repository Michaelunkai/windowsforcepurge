Imagine a scenario where you have a best friend, someone you’ve known since you were a kid, that you also work with today.
00:07
One day your manager, whom you are also very close to, confides in you that your childhood friend
00:11
will soon be laid off from their job, and they ask you to keep it confidential for now.
00:16
Later that day your friend calls you to share their excitement that they are planning on buying a new house!
00:21
Oh no, what do you do!?
00:24
An ethical dilemma is a situation where a difficult choice has to be made between different courses of action, each of which entails transgressing a moral principle.
00:33
Not making a decision is the same as making a decision to do nothing.
00:36
They are uncertain and complicated and require a close examination of your values to solve.
00:42
It’s important to note that an ethical dilemma is different from a moral temptation.
00:48
A temptation is a choice between a right and wrong, and specifically, when doing something wrong is advantageous to you.
00:55
Imagine you’re leaving a movie theater after seeing a film and notice that another movie you’d love to also see is starting.
01:02
No one is around to check tickets.
01:04
Do you go?
01:05
This would not be considered an ethical dilemma, but a moral temptation.
01:11
So in our first scenario, do you share the information with your friend despite the request from your manager to keep it quiet?
01:17
Do you pretend you don't know anything and keep the confidence of your manager?
01:21
Do you find some other way to warn them without crossing that line?
01:26
Different options are justifiable and could be considered ethical, depending upon who you ask.
01:31
Despite the lack of a right answer, a difficult choice has to be made.
01:36
When building AI, there are many ethical dilemmas that may need to be confronted, due to the impact AI can have on society.
01:43
This is why the focus on ethics must remain at the forefront in the AI community.
01:49
Consider these headlines.
01:51
Building digital trust will be essential to adoption of AI tools.
01:56
Great promise but potential for peril: Ethical concerns mount as AI takes bigger decision-making role in more industries.
02:05
Responsible AI becomes critical in 2021.
02:09
These headlines highlight the importance of Responsible AI for companies and for society.
02:16
According to a Capgemini report in 2020, there is a growing demand from a wide range of stakeholders,
02:21
both internal and external, for companies to develop more robust ethical values, processes, expertise, corporate culture, and leadership.
02:32
But what exactly do we mean when we talk about ethics?
02:37
In general terms, ethics is an ongoing process of articulating values, and in turn, questioning and justifying
02:41
decisions based on those values, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, or specific virtues.
02:51
Ultimately, ethics is what allows everyone to flourish together as a society.
02:56
This isn’t to say that there aren’t elements of subjectivity and cultural relativity that need to be acknowledged and confronted.
03:04
When looking at ethical frameworks and theories from around the world, the various approaches can often be
03:08
contradictory, but regardless of the approach you align with, ethics is the art of living well with others.
03:15
As such, it is crucial that ethical deliberation draws on a diverse set of perspectives and experiences.
03:22
However, ethics doesn’t lend itself well to rules or checklists, especially when trying to wade through moral challenges that have never existed before- -like those created through groundbreaking technology.
03:34
There’s an element of ingenuity needed to help solve new moral challenges that haven’t yet been faced.
03:41
It requires humility, a willingness to confront difficult questions, as well as change opinions in the face of new evidence and valid objections.
03:49
It’s also important to understand that ethics should not be viewed as law and policy.
03:55
Ethics reflect values and expectations we have of one another--most of which have not been written down or enforced by a formal system.
04:03
While laws and policies often do draw insight from ethics, many unethical acts are legal, and some ethical acts are illegal.
04:10
For example, most types of lying, breaking promises, or cheating are generally recognized as being unethical but
04:15
are often legal, while some of the most heroic acts of civil disobedience were illegal at the time.
04:23
At the end of the day, defining what ethics means to your organization should compel you to think about the
04:27
bonds of trust you want to have with your users, your teams, and the wider society through the work they do.
04:35
Without that trust, strong customer relationships won’t exist.
04:41
Organizations are rapidly recognizing the need for responsible AI.
04:44
The challenges with advanced technologies are multiplying as the social, political, and environmental impact of 21st-century technology rapidly expands.
04:55
Technologies using AI have the power to unintentionally replicate harms at incredible speed and scale, making the need for a thoughtful, careful approach even more important.
05:05
Capgemini’s AI and the Ethical conundrum survey in 2020 shows that twice as many executives are aware of AI-related issues than there were in 2019, and
05:14
the percentage of organizations that have defined an ethical charter to provide guidelines on AI development has increased from 5% to 45% in that same time period.
