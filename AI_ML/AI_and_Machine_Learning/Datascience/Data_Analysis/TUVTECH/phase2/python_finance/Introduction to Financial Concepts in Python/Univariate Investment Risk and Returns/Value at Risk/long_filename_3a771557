First of all, I'd like to say congratulations for making it to the end of this course.

2. Summary
00:09 - 01:07
I hope you've learned a lot. We really covered a massive amount of important financial topics ranging from statistical properties to portfolio compositions. You learned how to build correlation matrices, optimize portfolios, and conduct multi-factor analyses in search of Alpha. Finally, you learned about simulations and value at risk - even running some Monte Carlo simulations. All of these methods are used on Wall Street, and have been used to generated immense amounts of wealth. Now it's up to you to expand on these methods and to learn about more complex risk and portfolio models.

3. Good luck!
