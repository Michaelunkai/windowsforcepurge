1. Financial concepts in your daily life
00:00 - 00:12
First of all, I'd like to say congratulations for making it to the end of this course.

2. Congratulations
00:12 - 01:03
I hope you've learned a lot. We really covered a large spectrum of financial topics ranging from mortgages and time value of money functions to budgeting and saving for retirement, or making financial decisions as a CEO. Mastering these concepts will allow you to take control of your future. Some of these exercises showed how difficult it is to save for retirement, and how a small change in your portfolio return or even inflation can dramatically impact your wealth over time. For this reason, it's better to save more than the amount you plan on having for retirement. You can apply these same concepts when you decide to take out a mortgage, take a new job move to a new city or when you apply for a new credit card, for example. Finally, this course is a great entry point into working with investment portfolios, and a good next step is understanding risk management and the basics of portfolio construction.

3. Congratulations!

Once again, congratulations for making it through this course, and I wish you good returns in your future.
