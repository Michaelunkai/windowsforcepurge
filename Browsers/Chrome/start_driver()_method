The method used in the code for managing the ChromeDriver setup is called start_driver(). This method sets up and initializes an undetected ChromeDriver session with specific configurations such as a fake user agent and persistent user data. It also uses webdriver_manager to automatically download and install the correct version of ChromeDriver.

Here is the full code for the start_driver() method:

Method Code: start_driver()
 
 
def start_driver():
    # Set up undetected ChromeDriver with options
    options = webdriver.ChromeOptions()
    options.add_argument(f"user-agent={UserAgent().random}")  # Use a random user agent to simulate different browsers
    options.add_argument("user-data-dir=./")  # Store Chrome user data locally to persist login and session data
    
    # Initialize the Chrome driver using undetected-chromedriver and webdriver-manager
    driver = uc.Chrome(driver_executable_path=ChromeDriverManager().install(), options=options)
    
    return driver
Explanation:
options.add_argument(f"user-agent={UserAgent().random}"): Adds a random user agent to the Chrome session using the fake_useragent library, simulating different browser versions and environments.

options.add_argument("user-data-dir=./"): Persists Chrome user data, such as cookies and session information, by storing it locally. This means that if you log in to a website (like ChatGPT), the session will remain active in subsequent runs of the script.

uc.Chrome(driver_executable_path=ChromeDriverManager().install(), options=options):

undetected-chromedriver (uc) is used to prevent detection by websites that try to block bots or automated browsers.
ChromeDriverManager().install() is provided by webdriver_manager to automatically download and install the correct version of ChromeDriver. This way, you donâ€™t need to manually manage the driver or its path.
