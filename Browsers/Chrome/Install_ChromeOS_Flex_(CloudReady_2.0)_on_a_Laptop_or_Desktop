Things You Will Need
A USB flash drive, at least 16 GB https://amzn.to/3wkR5ju | https://amzn.to/3qkrJ1p | https://amzn.to/3Nhu9b9
Creating the Installation Media
PRO TIP: I repeatedly had issues booting the flash drive created by the Chromebook Recovery Utility. I found that the utility downloads ChromeOS Flex to the user's local temp directory (%temp% or %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp). Browse through the scoped_dir directories to find the compressed ChromeOS Flex image. I grabbed the file and used Balena Etcher to write it to a flash drive to correct the booting issue
