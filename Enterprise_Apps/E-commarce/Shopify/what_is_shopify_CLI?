- **Creating new Shopify apps or themes** from scratch with boilerplate code.
- **Running apps locally** during development using local servers with secure tunnels to your Shopify store.
- **Managing Shopify stores** by interacting with themes, apps, and extensions.
- **Deploying apps** to production with a simple command.

Key features of Shopify CLI include:

- **Theme development**: Build and customize Shopify store themes.
- **App development**: Develop Shopify apps using frameworks like Node.js, Ruby on Rails, and more.
- **Development server**: Serve apps locally during development, complete with tunneling.
- **Shop management**: Manage Shopify stores, authenticate, and interact with Shopify APIs.

In short, Shopify CLI helps streamline the development workflow for building and managing Shopify-based applications or themes.
