Configure Golem Node
After installation, you will need to configure your node by providing a few details. The system will prompt you for the following settings:

Node Name: You will be asked to provide a name for your node. If you don't specify one, a default name will be generated automatically.

Ethereum Wallet Address: You can either provide your own Ethereum wallet address or allow Golem to generate one for you. It's recommended to use your own wallet for managing earnings.

Price (GLM per Hour): Set the price for how much you want to charge per hour for providing your computing resources. The default is 0.1 GLM per hour, but you can set a more competitive price based on the current market rates. For instance, you can set it to 0.025 GLM.

Once youâ€™ve filled in the information, press Enter to save the settings.
