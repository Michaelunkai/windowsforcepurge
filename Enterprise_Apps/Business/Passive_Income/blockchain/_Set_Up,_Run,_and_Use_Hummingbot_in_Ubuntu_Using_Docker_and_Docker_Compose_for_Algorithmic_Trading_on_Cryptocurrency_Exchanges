### **Step-by-Step Tutorial to Set Up, Run, and Use Hummingbot in Ubuntu Using Docker and Docker Compose for Algorithmic Trading on Cryptocurrency Exchanges**

This tutorial will guide you through the detailed steps to set up, run, and use **Hummingbot** for algorithmic trading on cryptocurrency exchanges. The tutorial includes the installation and configuration of **Docker** and **Docker Compose** in **Ubuntu**, as these tools are essential for running Hummingbot effectively.

#### **Step 1: Install Docker on Ubuntu**
Docker is required to run Hummingbot as it uses containerization. If Docker is not installed on your system, follow the steps below:

  
sudo apt install docker.io -y
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker

This installs Docker and sets it up to start automatically on boot.

#### **Step 2: Add User to Docker Group to Avoid Using Sudo**
By default, Docker requires `sudo` for most commands. To make it more convenient, add your user to the Docker group:

  
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

This ensures that you can run Docker commands without needing to use `sudo`.

#### **Step 3: Install Docker Compose**
Docker Compose is required to handle multi-container Docker applications. Install Docker Compose using the following command:

  
sudo apt-get install docker-compose -y

#### **Step 4: Create a Folder for Hummingbot Files**
Now, create a folder where you will store the configuration files for Hummingbot:

  
mkdir ~/hummingbot_files
cd ~/hummingbot_files

This will create a directory called `hummingbot_files` in your home folder and switch to that directory.

#### **Step 5: Download and Run Hummingbot Using Docker**
Use Docker to download and run Hummingbot by executing the following command:

  
docker run -it \
--name hummingbot-instance \
--mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/hummingbot_files \
coinalpha/hummingbot:latest

This command will pull the latest Hummingbot Docker image and bind the `hummingbot_files` folder to your container.

#### **Step 6: Start Hummingbot Instance**
To start Hummingbot, use the following command:

  
docker start -ia hummingbot-instance

This will bring up the interactive Hummingbot console where you can configure and run strategies.

#### **Step 7: Configure Hummingbot**
Once Hummingbot is running, enter the configuration menu to set up API keys for your exchange, define strategies, and configure your wallet:

  
config

Follow the on-screen prompts to input your exchange API keys, wallet information, and select a trading strategy.

#### **Step 8: Start Your Trading Strategy**
Once you have configured everything, start your strategy by typing:

  
start

This will launch your trading bot based on the selected strategy and configuration.

#### **Step 9: Stop and Restart Hummingbot**
To stop Hummingbot, use the following command:

  
docker stop hummingbot-instance

To restart the Hummingbot instance later, use:

  
docker start -ia hummingbot-instance

This will reload the Hummingbot bot with your saved configurations.

With these steps, you have successfully set up and run **Hummingbot** on **Ubuntu** using **Docker** and **Docker Compose**. You are now ready to begin algorithmic trading on cryptocurrency exchanges!
