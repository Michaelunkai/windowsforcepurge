Build From Source
If you are unable to use the prebuilt binaries or prefer to build it yourself from source, follow these steps, ensuring you have the necessary prerequisites installed on your system.

Prerequisites
Before building from source, make sure to install the following prerequisites:

For Debian and Other Linux Distributions:
Rust Programming Language: Check "Install Rust" at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install, which recommends the following command.

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Install build dependencies:

Build essential
Package config
Udev & LLM & libclang
Protocol buffers
apt-get install \
    build-essential \
    pkg-config \
    libudev-dev llvm libclang-dev \
    protobuf-compiler

For Other Linux Distributions:
Replace apt with your distribution's package manager (e.g., yum, dnf, pacman) and adjust package names as needed.

For macOS:
Install Homebrew (if not already installed), check "Install Hombrew" at https://brew.sh/, which recommends the following command:

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"


Install the necessary tools and libraries using Homebrew:

brew install rust pkg-config libudev protobuf llvm coreutils

Follow the instructions given at the end of the brew install command about PATH configurations.

For Windows:
Rust Programming Language: Check "Install Rust" at https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install, which recommends the following command.

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Download and install the Build Tools for Visual Studio (2019 or later) from the Visual Studio downloads page. Make sure to include the C++ build tools in the installation.
Install LLVM: Download and install LLVM from the official LLVM download page.
Install Protocol Buffers Compiler (protoc): Download protoc from the GitHub releases page of Protocol Buffers, and add it to your PATH.
