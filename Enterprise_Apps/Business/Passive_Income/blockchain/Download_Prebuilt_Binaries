If you would rather not use solana-install to manage the install, you can manually download and install the binaries.

Linux
Download the binaries by navigating to https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest, download solana-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2, then extract the archive:

tar jxf solana-release-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.bz2
cd solana-release/
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH

MacOS
Download the binaries by navigating to https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest, download solana-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2, then extract the archive:

tar jxf solana-release-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.bz2
cd solana-release/
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH

Windows
Download the binaries by navigating to https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/releases/latest, download solana-release-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.bz2, then extract the archive using WinZip or similar.

Open a Command Prompt and navigate to the directory into which you extracted the binaries and run:

cd solana-release/
set PATH=%cd%/bin;%PATH%
