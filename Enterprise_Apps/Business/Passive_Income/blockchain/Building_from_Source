Building from Source
After installing the prerequisites, proceed with building Solana from source, navigate to Solana's GitHub releases page, and download the Source Code archive. Extract the code and build the binaries with:

./scripts/cargo-install-all.  .
export PATH=$PWD/bin:$PATH

You can then run the following command to obtain the same result as with prebuilt binaries:

solana-install init

Use Homebrew
This option requires you to have Homebrew package manager on your MacOS or Linux machine.

MacOS & Linux
Follow instructions at: https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/solana
Homebrew formulae is updated after each solana release, however it is possible that the Homebrew version is outdated.

Confirm you have the desired version of solana installed by entering:
solana --version
