Convert Monero (XMR) to Cash and Withdraw to Your Bank Account
To convert your mined Monero into cash and withdraw it to your bank account, you will need to use a cryptocurrency exchange.

Choose an Exchange:

Use an exchange that supports Monero (XMR), such as Binance, Kraken, or KuCoin.
Create an account and verify your identity if required.
Get Your Exchange's Deposit Address:

In the exchange, go to your wallet and find the deposit address for Monero (XMR).
Transfer Monero from Your Wallet to the Exchange:

Open your Monero wallet and use the transfer command to send Monero to the exchangeâ€™s deposit address:

 
 
transfer <EXCHANGE_ADDRESS> <AMOUNT>
Replace <EXCHANGE_ADDRESS> with the deposit address from your exchange, and <AMOUNT> with the amount of Monero you want to send.

Convert Monero to Fiat Currency:
