Geth (Go Ethereum) is a command-line interface (CLI) tool and a full implementation of the Ethereum node software written in Go. It allows users to run an Ethereum node, interact with the Ethereum blockchain, and manage Ethereum wallets.

### **Geth Wallet Overview:**
A **Geth wallet** is essentially a wallet stored on your local machine, managed through Geth, that holds your private and public keys. It enables you to:
- Store, send, and receive Ether (ETH).
- Interact with Ethereum smart contracts.
- Manage Ethereum accounts.

When using Geth, your **wallet** is a collection of Ethereum accounts, and each account holds an address used to manage Ether and smart contract interactions. Geth allows you to:
1. Create new accounts.
2. Unlock accounts.
3. Send Ether to other Ethereum addresses.
4. Deploy or interact with smart contracts.

### **Key Features:**
- **Full Node**: Geth syncs with the Ethereum blockchain, allowing you to validate transactions and blocks, and interact directly with the Ethereum network.
- **Account Management**: You can create, import, and manage multiple Ethereum accounts.
- **Security**: Since Geth runs locally, you have full control over your private keys and wallet, with no reliance on third-party services.
- **Smart Contract Interaction**: Using Geth, you can deploy and interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum network.
