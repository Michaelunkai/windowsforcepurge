Test the Validium
Congratulations! Your local zkValidium is now up and running. Let's test its functionalities.

First, verify the block explorer by navigating to localhost:4001. You should see a page similar to this:

Now, let's add the network to your Web3 wallet by populating the necessary fields.

We'll use MetaMask for our example.

Set the chain ID to be 1001.
The currency symbol can be anything but we will use POL by default.
The RPC node and block explorer containers can be found at ports 8123 and 4001, respectively.
Next, switch to the new network.

By default, an account with private key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 has been preloaded with tokens.

Note: NEVER transfer real assets to the address associated with the above private key

Import this account and you will see the balance shown up as 100000 POL. You can now try a transaction by transferring some tokens to another account. After confirming the transaction, check the updated balances. You can also view the transaction details in the block explorer by clicking on the transaction details in MetaMask.
