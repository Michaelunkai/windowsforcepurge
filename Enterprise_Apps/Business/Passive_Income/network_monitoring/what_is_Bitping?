Bitping is a decentralized network that monitors internet performance by utilizing idle resources from user-operated nodes. These nodes perform uptime monitoring, latency checks, and other network diagnostics for websites and services. In return, users who run Bitping nodes earn passive income by contributing their bandwidth and computing power to the network.

Essentially, Bitping allows companies and developers to ensure their services are running smoothly worldwide by crowdsourcing the monitoring tasks, while users earn money for their participation.
