Mysterium Network offers a way for individuals to earn **passive income** by running a **node** and sharing their unused internet bandwidth. Here's how it works:

1. **Becoming a Node Operator**: Users can set up a Mysterium node on their devices (such as a computer or Raspberry Pi). This node allows others to route their internet traffic through the node, providing VPN-like services.

2. **Earning MYST Tokens**: When users connect to the internet through your node, you get paid in **MYST** (the native cryptocurrency token of the Mysterium Network) for the bandwidth they use.

3. **Passive Income**: Once your node is set up, it runs in the background without requiring active involvement, making it a potential source of passive income. The more stable and reliable your node is, the more likely users will route their traffic through it, increasing your earnings.

The amount of income generated depends on factors like:
- **Bandwidth**: How much data you're sharing.
- **Location**: Some regions may have more demand for VPN services than others.
- **Uptime**: The longer your node is available and running, the more it can earn.

In essence, Mysterium Network turns your excess internet bandwidth into a revenue stream, providing an easy way to generate passive income.
