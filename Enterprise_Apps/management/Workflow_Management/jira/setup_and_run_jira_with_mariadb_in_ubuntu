How to Install and Configure JIRA on Ubuntu 22.04
Introduction
This tutorial will guide you through the steps to install and configure JIRA on an Ubuntu 22.04 server. You'll learn how to install MariaDB, set up a JIRA database, download and install JIRA, configure it, and finally access the JIRA web interface.

Step 1: Install MariaDB Server
First, you need to install the MariaDB server on your server.

Install MariaDB server:

sudo apt-get install mariadb-server
Check the MariaDB status:

sudo systemctl status mariadb
Step 2: Configure MariaDB for JIRA
Log in to MariaDB:

sudo mariadb -u root -p
Create a database and a user for JIRA:

CREATE DATABASE jiradb CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_bin;
CREATE USER 'jirauser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
Grant all privileges to the JIRA database:

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON jiradb.* TO 'jirauser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
Step 3: Download and Install JIRA
Navigate to your home directory:

cd ~
Download the JIRA installer:

wget https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/binary/atlassian-jira-software-9.12.0-x64.bin
Make the downloaded file executable:

chmod a+x atlassian-jira-software-9.12.0-x64.bin
Run the installer:

sudo ./atlassian-jira-software-9.12.0-x64.bin
Follow the installation prompts, choosing the appropriate options and paths.

Step 4: Configure JIRA to Use MariaDB
Download the MariaDB JDBC driver:

wget https://downloads.mariadb.com/Connectors/java/connector-java-2.7.4/mariadb-java-client-2.7.4.jar
Copy the MariaDB connector to the JIRA installation directory:

sudo cp mariadb-java-client-2.7.4.jar /opt/atlassian/jira/lib/
Restart the JIRA service to apply the changes:

sudo /etc/init.d/jira stop
sudo /etc/init.d/jira start
Step 5: Access the JIRA Web Interface
Open your web browser and access the JIRA web interface using:

http://your-server-ip:8080
If you receive a security warning, click "Advanced" and proceed to the site.

Step 6: JIRA Initial Setup
Select "I'll set it up myself" and click Next.
Choose "My own database", enter your database details, and click Next.
Specify the name of your application, mode, URL, and click Next.
Enter your trial license key and click Next.
Provide your administrator account details and click Next.
Click "Done" to complete the installation.
Step 7: Create Your First Project
Select the language you need and click Continue.
Choose your avatar and click Next.
Click "Create New Project" to create your first project.
Select "Scrum Software Development" and click Next.
Click "Select" to choose your workflow.
Enter the name of your project and the key, then click "Submit".
You should now see the JIRA dashboard.
