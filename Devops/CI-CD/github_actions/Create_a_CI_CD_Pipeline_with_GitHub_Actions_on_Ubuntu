### Step-by-Step Guide to Create a CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions on Ubuntu WSL2

This guide will help you set up a CI/CD pipeline for your GitHub repository using GitHub Actions on Ubuntu WSL2. The workflow files will be stored in the `.git/` folder instead of the default `.github/` folder. Additionally, we will add steps to sync every push to your repository on your Ubuntu desktop server and any other server with the repository.

#### 1. Set Up Your GitHub Repository
Ensure your GitHub repository is set up and accessible. Your repository is located at `/mnt/c/study`.

#### 2. Create the Workflow Directory
Create a directory for your GitHub Actions workflows inside the `.git/` folder.
```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/c/study/.git/workflows
```

#### 3. Create a Workflow File
Create a new workflow file in the `.git/workflows` directory. For example, create a file named `ci.yml`.
```bash
nano /mnt/c/study/.git/workflows/ci.yml
```

#### 4. Define the Workflow
Add the following YAML configuration to the `ci.yml` file. This example runs a simple CI job that triggers on every push to the main branch and syncs the repository to multiple servers.
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

    - name: Sync to Ubuntu Desktop Server
      run: |
        ssh user@ubuntu-desktop 'cd /path/to/repo && git pull origin main'

    - name: Sync to Another Server
      run: |
        ssh user@another-server 'cd /path/to/repo && git pull origin main'
```

#### 5. Commit and Push the Workflow
Commit the new workflow file to your repository and push the changes.
```bash
cd /mnt/c/study
git add .git/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "Add CI workflow"
git push origin main
```

#### 6. Verify the Workflow
Go to the Actions tab of your GitHub repository to verify that the workflow runs automatically on every push to the main branch.

#### Additional Configuration: Using WSL in GitHub Actions
If you need to run specific commands in WSL, you can use the `setup-wsl` action. Here is an example of how to set it up in your workflow:
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Setup WSL
      uses: Vampire/setup-wsl@v3

    - name: Run script in WSL
      run: |
        wsl npm install
        wsl npm test
```

This configuration ensures that your commands run within the WSL environment.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, you can set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions that runs on every push to your repository. The workflow files are stored in the `.git/workflows` directory as specified. This setup allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment processes efficiently, and ensures that your repository is synced across multiple servers.
