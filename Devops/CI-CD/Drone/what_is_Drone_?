**Drone** is a container-native **CI/CD** platform that automates the software development process, including building, testing, and deploying code. It uses **pipelines** defined in YAML files, which are executed inside isolated Docker containers. Drone supports multiple programming languages, environments, and integrates with popular version control systems like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.
