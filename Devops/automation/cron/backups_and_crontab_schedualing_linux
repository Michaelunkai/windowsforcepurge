Step-by-Step Tutorial: Linux Backups, Cron, and Scripting
This tutorial will guide you through the process of setting up automated backups on a Linux system using cron jobs and  ell scripting. We'll cover accessing a remote server, creating a backup script, and scheduling it with cron.

Prerequisites
A Linux server or a Unix-based system
Basic knowledge of SSH,  ell scripting, and cron jobs
Step 1: Access the Remote Server
Open a terminal.
Connect to your remote server using SSH:
 
 
s  student@192.168.1.1
Switch to the root user:
 
 
sudo -s
Step 2: Prepare the Directories for Backup
Identify the directories you want to back up:
/var/www/html
/etc
/var/log/apache2
Step 3: Create the Backup Script
Create a directory for your backups:
 
 
mkdir /opt/backups
Create a new script file:
 
 
vi /opt/backups/backup_daily. 
Add the following content to the script:
 
 
#!/bin/ 
# Backup script

# Set date variable
VAR_DATE=$(date +'%Y%m%d.%H%M')

# Create backup file
tar czf /opt/backups/daily-$VAR_DATE.tar.gz /etc /var/www/html /var/log/apache2

# Make the script executable
chmod 775 /opt/backups/backup_daily. 
Step 4: Test the Backup Script
Run the script manually to ensure it works:
 
 
/opt/backups/backup_daily. 
Verify the backup file:
 
 
ls /opt/backups
Step 5: Schedule the Backup Script with Cron
Edit the crontab file:
 
 
vi /etc/crontab
Add a new cron job to run the script daily at 3 AM:
 
 
0 3 * * * root /opt/backups/backup_daily. 
Step 6: Create a Weekly Backup Script
Copy the daily backup script to create a weekly one:
 
 
cp /opt/backups/backup_daily.  /opt/backups/backup_weekly. 
Edit the new script:
 
 
vi /opt/backups/backup_weekly. 
Modify the script to include "weekly" in the filename:
 
 
#!/bin/ 
# Weekly backup script

# Set date variable
VAR_DATE=$(date +'%Y%m%d.%H%M')

# Create backup file
tar czf /opt/backups/weekly-$VAR_DATE.tar.gz /etc /var/www/html /var/log/apache2

# Make the script executable
chmod 775 /opt/backups/backup_weekly. 
Step 7: Schedule the Weekly Backup Script with Cron
Edit the crontab file:
 
 
vi /etc/crontab
Add a new cron job to run the script weekly on Sundays at 3 AM:
 
 
0 3 * * 0 root /opt/backups/backup_weekly. 
Conclusion
By following these steps, you have successfully set up daily and weekly backups on your Linux server using cron jobs and  ell scripting. Make sure to monitor your backup directory to ensure that backups are being created as scheduled and adjust your scripts and cron jobs as necessary for your specific needs.
