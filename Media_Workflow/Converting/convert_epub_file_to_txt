 You can use the command-line tool "ebook-convert" from Calibre to convert an EPUB file to a plain text (txt) file. Here's how you can do it in the terminal:

Install Calibre:

If you don't have Calibre installed, you can install it on Linux using the package manager:

 
 
sudo apt-get install calibre
On macOS, you can use Homebrew:

 
 
brew install calibre
On Windows, download and install Calibre from the official website: https://calibre-ebook.com/download

Convert EPUB to TXT:

Open a terminal window.

Navigate to the directory where your EPUB file is located. For example, if your EPUB file is on the desktop:

 
 
cd ~/Desktop
Use the following command to convert the EPUB file to a TXT file:

 
 
ebook-convert yourfile.epub yourfile.txt
Replace "yourfile.epub" with the actual name of your EPUB file.

Copy Text to Balabolka:

Open the generated TXT file using a text editor or a terminal-based tool like "cat" or "less."

 
 
cat yourfile.txt
Copy the entire text from the terminal or text editor.

Paste into Balabolka:

Open Balabolka and paste the copied text into the application.
Configure Balabolka Settings:

Follow the steps mentioned earlier to configure voice, speed, and other settings in Balabolka.
Save as Audiobook:

Save the audiobook as mentioned in the previous steps.
This process allows you to convert the EPUB file to plain text using the terminal and then use Balabolka to convert the text to an audiobook.
